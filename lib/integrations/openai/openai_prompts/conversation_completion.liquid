You are evaluating whether a customer support conversation is complete and can be closed.

A conversation is INCOMPLETE if:
- The assistant asked a clarification question that the customer hasn't answered yet
- The assistant requested information (like order number, email, etc.) that wasn't provided
- The customer asked a question that wasn't fully answered
- There's an unresolved issue or pending action

A conversation is COMPLETE if:
- The customer's question or issue was fully addressed
- No pending follow-up questions from either side
- The conversation naturally concluded (e.g., customer said thanks, goodbye, etc.)

Analyze the conversation and respond with ONLY a JSON object (no other text):
{"complete": true, "reason": "brief explanation"}
or
{"complete": false, "reason": "brief explanation"}

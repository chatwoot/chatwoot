[**hast**][hast] utility to parse the [*tree*][tree] again, now supporting
embedded `raw` nodes.

One of the reasons to do this is for “malformed” syntax trees: for example, say
there’s an `h1` element in a `p` element, this utility will make them siblings.

Another reason to do this is if raw HTML/XML is embedded in a syntax tree, which
can occur when coming from Markdown using [`mdast-util-to-hast`][to-hast].

If you’re working with [**remark**][remark] and/or
[`remark-rehype`][remark-rehype], use [`rehype-raw`][rehype-raw] instead.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install hast-util-raw
```

## Use

```js
var h = require('hastscript')
var raw = require('hast-util-raw')

var tree = h('div', [h('h1', ['Foo ', h('h2', 'Bar'), ' Baz'])])

var clean = raw(tree)

console.log(clean)
```

Yields:

```js
{ type: 'element',
  tagName: 'div',
  properties: {},
  children:
   [ { type: 'element',
       tagName: 'h1',
       properties: {},
       children: [Object] },
     { type: 'element',
       tagName: 'h2',
       properties: {},
       children: [Object] },
     { type: 'text', value: ' Baz' } ] }
```

## API

### `raw(tree[, file])`

Given a [**hast**][hast] [*tree*][tree] and an optional [vfile][] (for
[positional info][position-information]), return a new parsed-again
[**hast**][hast] [*tree*][tree].

## Security

Use of `hast-util-raw` can open you up to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss]
attack as `raw` nodes are unsafe.
The following example shows how a raw node is used to inject a script that runs
when loaded in a browser.

```js
raw(u('root', [u('raw', '<script>alert(1)</script>')]))
```

Yields:

```html
<script>alert(1)</script>
```

Do not use this utility in combination with user input or use
[`hast-util-santize`][sanitize].

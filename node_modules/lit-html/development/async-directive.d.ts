/**
 * Overview:
 *
 * This module is designed to add support for an async `setValue` API and
 * `disconnected` callback to directives with the least impact on the core
 * runtime or payload when that feature is not used.
 *
 * The strategy is to introduce a `AsyncDirective` subclass of
 * `Directive` that climbs the "parent" tree in its constructor to note which
 * branches of lit-html's "logical tree" of data structures contain such
 * directives and thus need to be crawled when a subtree is being cleared (or
 * manually disconnected) in order to run the `disconnected` callback.
 *
 * The "nodes" of the logical tree include Parts, TemplateInstances (for when a
 * TemplateResult is committed to a value of a ChildPart), and Directives; these
 * all implement a common interface called `DisconnectableChild`. Each has a
 * `_$parent` reference which is set during construction in the core code, and a
 * `_$disconnectableChildren` field which is initially undefined.
 *
 * The sparse tree created by means of the `AsyncDirective` constructor
 * crawling up the `_$parent` tree and placing a `_$disconnectableChildren` Set
 * on each parent that includes each child that contains a
 * `AsyncDirective` directly or transitively via its children. In order to
 * notify connection state changes and disconnect (or reconnect) a tree, the
 * `_$notifyConnectionChanged` API is patched onto ChildParts as a directive
 * climbs the parent tree, which is called by the core when clearing a part if
 * it exists. When called, that method iterates over the sparse tree of
 * Set<DisconnectableChildren> built up by AsyncDirectives, and calls
 * `_$notifyDirectiveConnectionChanged` on any directives that are encountered
 * in that tree, running the required callbacks.
 *
 * A given "logical tree" of lit-html data-structures might look like this:
 *
 *  ChildPart(N1) _$dC=[D2,T3]
 *   ._directive
 *     AsyncDirective(D2)
 *   ._value // user value was TemplateResult
 *     TemplateInstance(T3) _$dC=[A4,A6,N10,N12]
 *      ._parts[]
 *        AttributePart(A4) _$dC=[D5]
 *         ._directives[]
 *           AsyncDirective(D5)
 *        AttributePart(A6) _$dC=[D7,D8]
 *         ._directives[]
 *           AsyncDirective(D7)
 *           Directive(D8) _$dC=[D9]
 *            ._directive
 *              AsyncDirective(D9)
 *        ChildPart(N10) _$dC=[D11]
 *         ._directive
 *           AsyncDirective(D11)
 *         ._value
 *           string
 *        ChildPart(N12) _$dC=[D13,N14,N16]
 *         ._directive
 *           AsyncDirective(D13)
 *         ._value // user value was iterable
 *           Array<ChildPart>
 *             ChildPart(N14) _$dC=[D15]
 *              ._value
 *                string
 *             ChildPart(N16) _$dC=[D17,T18]
 *              ._directive
 *                AsyncDirective(D17)
 *              ._value // user value was TemplateResult
 *                TemplateInstance(T18) _$dC=[A19,A21,N25]
 *                 ._parts[]
 *                   AttributePart(A19) _$dC=[D20]
 *                    ._directives[]
 *                      AsyncDirective(D20)
 *                   AttributePart(A21) _$dC=[22,23]
 *                    ._directives[]
 *                      AsyncDirective(D22)
 *                      Directive(D23) _$dC=[D24]
 *                       ._directive
 *                         AsyncDirective(D24)
 *                   ChildPart(N25) _$dC=[D26]
 *                    ._directive
 *                      AsyncDirective(D26)
 *                    ._value
 *                      string
 *
 * Example 1: The directive in ChildPart(N12) updates and returns `nothing`. The
 * ChildPart will _clear() itself, and so we need to disconnect the "value" of
 * the ChildPart (but not its directive). In this case, when `_clear()` calls
 * `_$notifyConnectionChanged()`, we don't iterate all of the
 * _$disconnectableChildren, rather we do a value-specific disconnection: i.e.
 * since the _value was an Array<ChildPart> (because an iterable had been
 * committed), we iterate the array of ChildParts (N14, N16) and run
 * `setConnected` on them (which does recurse down the full tree of
 * `_$disconnectableChildren` below it, and also removes N14 and N16 from N12's
 * `_$disconnectableChildren`). Once the values have been disconnected, we then
 * check whether the ChildPart(N12)'s list of `_$disconnectableChildren` is empty
 * (and would remove it from its parent TemplateInstance(T3) if so), but since
 * it would still contain its directive D13, it stays in the disconnectable
 * tree.
 *
 * Example 2: In the course of Example 1, `setConnected` will reach
 * ChildPart(N16); in this case the entire part is being disconnected, so we
 * simply iterate all of N16's `_$disconnectableChildren` (D17,T18) and
 * recursively run `setConnected` on them. Note that we only remove children
 * from `_$disconnectableChildren` for the top-level values being disconnected
 * on a clear; doing this bookkeeping lower in the tree is wasteful since it's
 * all being thrown away.
 *
 * Example 3: If the LitElement containing the entire tree above becomes
 * disconnected, it will run `childPart.setConnected()` (which calls
 * `childPart._$notifyConnectionChanged()` if it exists); in this case, we
 * recursively run `setConnected()` over the entire tree, without removing any
 * children from `_$disconnectableChildren`, since this tree is required to
 * re-connect the tree, which does the same operation, simply passing
 * `isConnectd: true` down the tree, signaling which callback to run.

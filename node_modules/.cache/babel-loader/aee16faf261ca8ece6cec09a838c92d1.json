but are different in some languages.\n *    \"Formatting\" units are declined according to the rules of the language\n *    in the context of a date. \"Stand-alone\" units are always nominative singular.\n *    In `format` function, they will produce different result:\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do LLLL', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopad'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do MMMM', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopadu'`\n *\n *    `parse` will try to match both formatting and stand-alone units interchangably.\n *\n * 2. Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by\n *    the single quote characters (see below).\n *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table:\n *    - for numerical units (`yyyyyyyy`) `parse` will try to match a number\n *      as wide as the sequence\n *    - for text units (`MMMMMMMM`) `parse` will try to match the widest variation of the unit.\n *      These variations are marked with \"2\" in the last column of the table.\n *\n * 3. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.\n *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.\n *\n * 4. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:\n *\n *    | Year | `y` | `u` |\n *    |------|-----|-----|\n *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |\n *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |\n *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |\n *\n *    Also `yy` will try to guess the century of two digit year by proximity with `referenceDate`:\n *\n *    `parse('50', 'yy', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Sat Jan 01 2050 00:00:00`\n *\n *    `parse('75', 'yy', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Wed Jan 01 1975 00:00:00`\n *\n *    while `uu` will just assign the year as is:\n *\n *    `parse('50', 'uu', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Sat Jan 01 0050 00:00:00`\n *\n *    `parse('75', 'uu', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Tue Jan 01 0075 00:00:00`\n *\n *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),\n *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`\n *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [setISOWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/setISOWeekYear}\n *    and [setWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/setWeekYear}).\n *\n * 5. These patterns are not in the Unicode Technical Standard #35:\n *    - `i`: ISO day of week\n *    - `I`: ISO week of year\n *    - `R`: ISO week-numbering year\n *    - `o`: ordinal number modifier\n *    - `P`: long localized date\n *    - `p`: long localized time\n *\n * 6. `YY` and `YYYY` tokens represent week-numbering years but they are often confused with years.\n *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalWeekYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * 7. `D` and `DD` tokens represent days of the year but they are ofthen confused with days of the month.\n *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * 8. `P+` tokens do not have a defined priority since they are merely aliases to other tokens based\n *    on the given locale.\n *\n *    using `en-US` locale: `P` => `MM/dd/yyyy`\n *    using `en-US` locale: `p` => `hh:mm a`\n *    using `pt-BR` locale: `P` => `dd/MM/yyyy`\n *    using `pt-BR` locale: `p` => `HH:mm`\n *\n * Values will be assigned to the date in the descending order of its unit's priority.\n * Units of an equal priority overwrite each other in the order of appearance.\n *\n * If no values of higher priority are parsed (e.g. when parsing string 'January 1st' without a year),\n * the values will be taken from 3rd argument `referenceDate` which works as a context of parsing.\n *\n * `referenceDate` must be passed for correct work of the function.\n * If you're not sure which `referenceDate` to supply, create a new instance of Date:\n * `parse('02/11/2014', 'MM/dd/yyyy', new Date())`\n * In this case parsing will be done in the context of the current date.\n * If `referenceDate` is `Invalid Date` or a value not convertible to valid `Date`,\n * then `Invalid Date` will be returned.\n *\n * The result may vary by locale.\n *\n * If `formatString` matches with `dateString` but does not provides tokens, `referenceDate` will be returned.\n *\n * If parsing failed, `Invalid Date` will be returned.\n * Invalid Date is a Date, whose time value is NaN.\n * Time value of Date: http://es5.github.io/#x15.9.1.1\n *\n * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:\n *\n * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).\n *\n * - Old `parse` was renamed to `toDate`.\n *   Now `parse` is a new function which parses a string using a provided format.\n *\n *   ```javascript\n *   // Before v2.0.0\n *   parse('2016-01-01')\n *\n *   // v2.0.0 onward (toDate no longer accepts a string)\n *   toDate(1392098430000) // Unix to timestamp\n *   toDate(new Date(2014, 1, 11, 11, 30, 30)) // Cloning the date\n *   parse('2016-01-01', 'yyyy-MM-dd', new Date())\n *   ```\n *\n * @param {String} dateString - the string to parse\n * @param {String} formatString - the string of tokens\n * @param {Date|Number} referenceDate - defines values missing from the parsed dateString\n * @param {Object} [options] - an object with options.\n * @param {Locale} [options.locale=defaultLocale] - the locale object.

Combinations that don't make sense or could lead to bugs are prohibited\n * and will throw `RangeError`. For example usage of 24-hour format token with AM/PM token will throw an exception:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * isMatch('23 AM', 'HH a')\n * //=> RangeError: The format string mustn't contain `HH` and `a` at the same time\n * ```\n *\n * See the compatibility table:

but are different in some languages.\n *    \"Formatting\" units are declined according to the rules of the language\n *    in the context of a date. \"Stand-alone\" units are always nominative singular.\n *    In `format` function, they will produce different result:\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do LLLL', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopad'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do MMMM', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopadu'`\n *\n *    `isMatch` will try to match both formatting and stand-alone units interchangably.\n *\n * 2. Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by\n *    the single quote characters (see below).\n *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table:\n *    - for numerical units (`yyyyyyyy`) `isMatch` will try to match a number\n *      as wide as the sequence\n *    - for text units (`MMMMMMMM`) `isMatch` will try to match the widest variation of the unit.\n *      These variations are marked with \"2\" in the last column of the table.\n *\n * 3. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.\n *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.\n *\n * 4. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:\n *\n *    | Year | `y` | `u` |\n *    |------|-----|-----|\n *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |\n *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |\n *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |\n *\n *    Also `yy` will try to guess the century of two digit year by proximity with `referenceDate`:\n *\n *    `isMatch('50', 'yy') //=> true`\n *\n *    `isMatch('75', 'yy') //=> true`\n *\n *    while `uu` will use the year as is:\n *\n *    `isMatch('50', 'uu') //=> true`\n *\n *    `isMatch('75', 'uu') //=> true`\n *\n *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),\n *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`\n *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [setISOWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/setISOWeekYear}\n *    and [setWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/setWeekYear}).\n *\n * 5. These patterns are not in the Unicode Technical Standard #35:\n *    - `i`: ISO day of week\n *    - `I`: ISO week of year\n *    - `R`: ISO week-numbering year\n *    - `o`: ordinal number modifier\n *    - `P`: long localized date\n *    - `p`: long localized time\n *\n * 6. `YY` and `YYYY` tokens represent week-numbering years but they are often confused with years.\n *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalWeekYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * 7. `D` and `DD` tokens represent days of the year but they are ofthen confused with days of the month.\n *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * 8. `P+` tokens do not have a defined priority since they are merely aliases to other tokens based\n *    on the given locale.\n *\n *    using `en-US` locale: `P` => `MM/dd/yyyy`\n *    using `en-US` locale: `p` => `hh:mm a`\n *    using `pt-BR` locale: `P` => `dd/MM/yyyy`\n *    using `pt-BR` locale: `p` => `HH:mm`\n *\n * Values will be checked in the descending order of its unit's priority.\n * Units of an equal priority overwrite each other in the order of appearance.\n *\n * If no values of higher priority are matched (e.g. when matching string 'January 1st' without a year),\n * the values will be taken from today's using `new Date()` date which works as a context of parsing.\n *\n * The result may vary by locale.\n *\n * If `formatString` matches with `dateString` but does not provides tokens, `referenceDate` will be returned.\n *\n *\n *\n * @param {String} dateString - the date string to verify\n * @param {String} formatString - the string of tokens\n * @param {Object} [options] - an object with options.\n * @param {Locale} [options.locale=defaultLocale] - the locale object. See [Locale]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/Locale}\n * @param {0|1|2|3|4|5|6} [options.weekStartsOn=0] - the index of the first day of the week (0 - Sunday)\n * @param {1|2|3|4|5|6|7} [options.firstWeekContainsDate=1] - the day of January, which is always in the first week of the year\n * @param {Boolean} [options.useAdditionalWeekYearTokens=false] - if true, allows usage of the week-numbering year tokens `YY` and `YYYY`;\n *   see: https://git.io/fxCyr\n * @param {Boolean} [options.useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens=false] - if true, allows usage of the day of year tokens `D` and `DD`;\n *   see: https://git.io/fxCyr\n * @returns {Boolean}\n * @throws {TypeError} 2 arguments required\n * @throws {RangeError} `options.weekStartsOn` must be between 0 and 6\n * @throws {RangeError} `options.firstWeekContainsDate` must be between 1 and 7\n * @throws {RangeError} `options.locale` must contain `match` property\n * @throws {RangeError} use `yyyy` instead of `YYYY` for formatting years; see: https://git.io/fxCyr\n * @throws {RangeError} use `yy` instead of `YY` for formatting years; see: https://git.io/fxCyr\n * @throws {RangeError} use `d` instead of `D` for formatting days of the month; see: https://git.io/fxCyr\n * @throws {RangeError} use `dd` instead of `DD` for formatting days of the month; see: https://git.io/fxCyr\n * @throws {RangeError} format string contains an unescaped latin alphabet character\n *\n * @example\n * // Match 11 February 2014 from middle-endian format:\n * var result = isMatch('02/11/2014', 'MM/dd/yyyy')\n * //=> true\n *\n * @example\n * // Match 28th of February in Esperanto locale in the context of 2010 year:\n * import eo from 'date-fns/locale/eo'\n * var result = isMatch('28-a de februaro', \"do 'de' MMMM\", {\n *   locale: eo\n * })\n * //=> true\n */\n\nexport default function isMatch(dateString, formatString, dirtyOptions) {\n  requiredArgs(2, arguments);\n  return isValid(parse(dateString, formatString, new Date(), dirtyOptions));\n}","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}

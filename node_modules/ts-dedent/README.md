TypeScript package which smartly trims and strips indentation from multi-line strings.

## Usage Examples

```js
import dedent from 'dedent';

console.log(dedent`A string that gets so long you need to break it over
                    multiple lines. Luckily dedent is here to keep it
                    readable without lots of spaces ending up in the string
                    itself.`);

console.log(dedent`
  A string that gets so long you need to break it over
  multiple lines. Luckily dedent is here to keep it
  readable without lots of spaces ending up in the string
  itself.
`);
```

```txt

multiple lines. Luckily dedent is here to keep it
readable without lots of spaces ending up in the string
itself.
```

---

```js
console.log(dedent`
  Leading and trailing lines will be trimmed, so you can write something like
  this and have it work as you expect:

    * how convenient it is
    * that I can use an indented list
        - and still have it do the right thing

  That's all.
`);
```

```js
console.log(dedent`
  Also works fine

  ${1}. With any kind of
  ${2}. Placeholders
`);
```

```js
console.log(dedent(`
  Wait! I lied. Dedent can also be used as a function.
`);
```

```txt
Wait! I lied. Dedent can also be used as a function.
```

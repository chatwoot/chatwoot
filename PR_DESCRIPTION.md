# Pull Request Template

## Description

This PR implements differentiated email templates for account deletion notifications as described in Linear issue CW-5526.

The primary motivation is to:
* **Provide clear and differentiated communication** to users regarding account deletion based on the reason for deletion
* **Improve user experience** by sending appropriate email content for different deletion scenarios:
  * User-initiated account deletion requests
  * System-initiated account deletion due to inactivity

### Key Changes

**Enhanced Account Deletion Mailer:**
- Updated `AdministratorNotifications::AccountNotificationMailer` to route to specific methods based on deletion reason
- Added `account_deletion_user_initiated` method for manual deletions
- Added `account_deletion_system_initiated` method for system-initiated deletions
- Added date formatting helper for user-friendly deletion dates

**New Email Templates:**
- `account_deletion_user_initiated.liquid`: Clean confirmation email for user-requested deletions
- `account_deletion_system_initiated.liquid`: Detailed inactivity notification with reactivation instructions
- Maintained original `account_deletion.liquid` template as fallback

**Email Routing Logic:**
- If `reason == 'manual_deletion'` → Uses user-initiated template with subject "Your Chatwoot account deletion has been scheduled"
- If `reason != 'manual_deletion'` → Uses system-initiated template with subject "Your Chatwoot account is scheduled for deletion due to inactivity"

### Usage

```ruby
# User-initiated deletion
account.mark_for_deletion('manual_deletion')
# → Sends user-initiated deletion email

# System-initiated deletion  
account.mark_for_deletion('Account Inactive')
# → Sends system-initiated inactivity email
```

Fixes #CW-5526

**System-Initiated Deletion:**
```
Subject: Your Chatwoot account is scheduled for deletion due to inactivity

Hello there,

We've noticed that your Chatwoot account **"Acme Corp"** has been inactive for some time. Because of this, it's scheduled for deletion on **January 15, 2024**.

**How do I keep my account?**
Just log in to your Chatwoot account before **January 15, 2024**. From your account settings, you can cancel the deletion and continue using your account.

**What happens if I don't cancel?**
If there's no activity by **January 15, 2024**, your account and all associated data — including conversations, contacts, reports, and settings — will be permanently deleted.

**Why are we doing this?**
To keep things secure and efficient, we regularly remove inactive accounts so our systems remain optimized for active teams.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach us at **hello@chatwoot.com**.

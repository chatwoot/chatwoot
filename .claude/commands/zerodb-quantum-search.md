description: Hybrid quantum-classical vector search
---

Use the mcp__ainative-zerodb__zerodb_quantum_hybrid_search tool for enhanced semantic search.

Example usage:
- Advanced similarity search
- Quantum-enhanced vector matching
- Balanced classical/quantum results

Key parameters:
- query_vector: Query vector array (required)
- limit: Maximum results (default: 10)
- classical_weight: Classical similarity weight 0-1 (default: 0.7)
- quantum_weight: Quantum similarity weight 0-1 (default: 0.3)
- namespace: Vector namespace (optional)

Ask the user for their search query, then use the tool for quantum-enhanced search.

### Prompt to Continue "Conversate AI" Development

**Project:** Conversate AI
**High-Level Goal:** Build a new, AI-first communications platform from scratch based on the advanced "CDNA-X" architecture.

**Current Status:**
The foundational build-out of the platform is complete. The new codebase is located in the `conversate-ai/` directory. We have a secure, tested, multi-service backend and a functional frontend application.

The following components are at a "v1 complete" stage (modeled, built, secured, and tested):
*   **Backend Application Services:**
    *   `identity-service`: Manages users, accounts, and JWT authentication.
    *   `contact-service`: Manages CRM contacts.
    *   `conversation-service`: Manages real-time chat via WebSockets and is integrated with the AI engine.
*   **Backend AI Services (CDNA-X Core):**
    *   `csg-service`: The "memory" of the AI (Conversational State Graph).
    *   `sor-service`: The "retrieval" engine for the AI's knowledge base.
    *   `lor-service`: The "brain" of the AI, orchestrating the other services.
    *   `om-service`: The service for training and serving outcome-driven ML models (with a placeholder ML pipeline).
*   **Frontend Application (`web-app`):**
    *   A Vue.js 3 application with a complete, end-to-end user authentication flow and a functional real-time chat interface that gets intelligent responses from the AI backend.

**Key Reference Documents:**
The project's vision is detailed in two documents you provided previously: the "Conversate AI 2.0 Feature Inventory" and the "CDNA-X Technical Spec". Our telephony provider is **SignalWire**.

**Next Steps & Strategic Decision:**
The foundational platform is in place. The next phase of development can focus on either adding more **breadth** (new features) or more **depth** (improving the AI core).

Please advise on which of these two paths you would like to prioritize for the next session:

1.  **Add Breadth (New Channel):** We could begin implementing the "omnichannel" vision by adding a new communication channel. A good next step would be to integrate **Email Ingestion** into the `conversation-service`, allowing the platform to receive emails and turn them into conversations.
2.  **Add Depth (Real Machine Learning):** We could begin replacing the placeholder ML logic with a real implementation. A good next step would be to build out the actual training pipeline for the **Outcome Model (OM) Service**, using TensorFlow and the collected training data to create a real Decision Transformer model.

Which of these two objectives should we focus on next: **Email Integration** or the **ML Training Pipeline**?

# Chatwoot Internship Project Implementation Documentation

## Feature Implementation

### 1. Custom Branding Integration

#### 1.1 Logo and Brand Colors

- **Brand Colors:**
  - Modified `theme/colors.js` to use a purple color scheme (#8A57DE) as the primary brand color
  - Updated the woot color palette to use violet colors instead of blue

- **Logo Updates:**
  - Created custom SVG logos with the new "LiveIQ" branding
  - Updated files:
    - `public/brand-assets/logo.svg`: Main light-theme logo
    - `public/brand-assets/logo_dark.svg`: Dark theme logo variation
    - `public/brand-assets/logo_thumbnail.svg`: Favicon/icon version of the logo

#### 1.2 Captain to AI Agent Transformation

- **Model Renaming:**
  - Renamed `CaptainInbox` to `AIAgentInbox` in `enterprise/app/models/captain_inbox.rb`
  - Renamed `Captain::Assistant` to `AIAgent::Topic` in `enterprise/app/models/captain/assistant.rb`
  - Renamed `Captain::Document` to `AIAgent::Document` in `enterprise/app/models/captain/document.rb` 
  - Renamed `Captain::AssistantResponse` to `AIAgent::TopicResponse` in `enterprise/app/models/captain/assistant_response.rb`

- **Database Schema Changes:**
  - Created migration `db/migrate/20250601000001_rename_captain_tables_to_ai_agent.rb` to:
    - Rename tables (`captain_assistants` → `ai_agent_topics`, etc.)
    - Rename foreign key columns (`assistant_id` → `topic_id`, etc.)
    - Rename indexes to match new table and column names

### 2. Enhanced Conversation Features - Content Attributes

- **Model Updates:**
  - Added `content_attributes` jsonb field to `Conversation` model
  - Added validations and helper methods for the new field:
    - `content_attributes`, `content_attributes=`
    - `update_content_attributes`, `add_content_attribute`
    - `validate_content_attributes`
  - Added to change tracking in `allowed_keys?` method

- **Database Migration:**
  - Created migration `db/migrate/20250601000000_add_content_attributes_to_conversations.rb` to add the new field

- **UI Components:**
  - Created `ContentAttributes.vue` component to display content attributes in the conversation sidebar
  - Added translations to `app/javascript/dashboard/i18n/locale/en/conversation.json`

## Implementation Details

### Database Changes

The project includes two migrations:

1. **Add Content Attributes to Conversations:**
   ```ruby
   add_column :conversations, :content_attributes, :jsonb, default: {}, null: false
   ```

2. **Rename Captain Tables to AI Agent:**
   - Renamed tables and all their associated columns and indexes
   - Established proper associations between the new tables

### UI/UX Changes

The new branding uses a vibrant purple color scheme (#8A57DE) and a modern, clean logo design that represents the LiveIQ brand. The logo consists of:
- A network node visualization for the icon part
- Clear, modern typography for the brand name

### Code Architecture

The changes maintain the existing architecture while ensuring:
- All renamed models use the new namespace structure (`AIAgent::Topic` instead of `Captain::Assistant`)
- All relationships between models are properly maintained
- The UI displays content attributes in an organized and visually appealing way

## Next Steps

1. Update all references to the old names throughout the codebase (controllers, views, JavaScript files)
2. Implement meaningful use cases for the `content_attributes` field in conversations
3. Update UI components to fully integrate the AIAgent terminology
4. Update unit tests to reflect the new model names and relationships

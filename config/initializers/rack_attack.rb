class Rack::Attack

  ### Configure Cache ###

  # If you don't want to use Rails.cache (Rack::Attack's default), then
  # configure it here.
  #
  # Note: The store is only used for throttling (not blocklisting and
  # safelisting). It must implement .increment and .write like
  # ActiveSupport::Cache::Store

  # Rack::Attack.cache.store = ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore.new

  ### Throttle Spammy Clients ###

  # If any single client IP is making tons of requests, then they're
  # probably malicious or a poorly-configured scraper. Either way, they
  # don't deserve to hog all of the app server's CPU. Cut them off!
  #
  # Note: If you're serving assets through rack, those requests may be
  # counted by rack-attack and this throttle may be activated too
  # quickly. If so, enable the condition to exclude them from tracking.

  # Throttle all requests by IP (60rpm)
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:req/ip:#{req.ip}"
  throttle('req/ip', limit: 300, period: 5.minutes) do |req|
    req.ip
  end

  ### Prevent Brute-Force Login Attacks ###

  # The most common brute-force login attack is a brute-force password
  # attack where an attacker simply tries a large number of emails and
  # passwords to see if any credentials match.
  #
  # Another common method of attack is to use a swarm of computers with
  # different IPs to try brute-forcing a password for a specific account.

  # Throttle POST requests to /login by IP address
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:logins/ip:#{req.ip}"
  throttle('login/ip', limit: 5, period: 20.seconds) do |req|
    if req.path == '/auth/sign_in' && req.post?
      req.ip
    end
  end

  # Throttle POST requests to /login by email param
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:logins/email:#{normalized_email}"
  #
  # Note: This creates a problem where a malicious user could intentionally
  # throttle logins for another user and force their login requests to be
  # denied, but that's not very common and shouldn't happen to you. (Knock
  # on wood!)
  throttle('login/email', limit: 5, period: 20.seconds) do |req|
    if req.path == '/auth/sign_in' && req.post?
      # Normalize the email, using the same logic as your authentication process, to
      # protect against rate limit bypasses. Return the normalized email if present, nil otherwise.
      req.params['email'].to_s.downcase.gsub(/\s+/, "").presence
    end
  end

  throttle('reset_password/email', limit: 5, period: 20.seconds) do |req|
    if req.path == '/auth/reset_password' && req.post?
      # Normalize the email, using the same logic as your authentication process, to
      # protect against rate limit bypasses. Return the normalized email if present, nil otherwise.
      req.params['email'].to_s.downcase.gsub(/\s+/, "").presence
    end
  end

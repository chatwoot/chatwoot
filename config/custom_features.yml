# Custom Features Configuration
# This file defines custom features that are specific to this installation
# and not part of the core Chatwoot feature set.
#
# Each feature should have:
# - name: Internal name used in code (snake_case)
# - display_name: Human-readable name for UI
# - description: Brief description of the feature
# - enabled: Default enabled state for new accounts
# - tier: Feature availability tier (community, starter, professional, enterprise)
# - category: Feature category for organization (channel, integration, ai, etc.)
#
# Unlike config/features.yml, the order here does NOT matter for functionality
# since custom features use JSONB storage rather than bitmask positions.

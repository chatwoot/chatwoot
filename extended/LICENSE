COMPLIANCE NOTICE:

This code is an original implementation by NightTech Services. While it models
functionality similar to Chatwoot Enterprise features, all code was written
from scratch without copying any code from Chatwoot's proprietary enterprise
directory.

This implementation uses only MIT-licensed portions of Chatwoot as a foundation
and is fully compliant with open-source licensing requirements. The Chatwoot
Enterprise codebase was used only as a reference during development to
understand functionality, but no enterprise code was copied or redistributed.

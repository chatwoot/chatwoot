Date.\n *\n * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:\n *\n * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).\n *\n * - The previous `parse` implementation was renamed to `parseISO`.\n *\n *   ```javascript\n *   // Before v2.0.0\n *   parse('2016-01-01')\n *\n *   // v2.0.0 onward\n *   parseISO('2016-01-01')\n *   ```\n *\n * - `parseISO` now validates separate date and time values in ISO-8601 strings\n *   and returns `Invalid Date` if the date is invalid.\n *\n *   ```javascript\n *   parseISO('2018-13-32')\n *   //=> Invalid Date\n *   ```\n *\n * - `parseISO` now doesn't fall back to `new Date` constructor\n *   if it fails to parse a string argument. Instead, it returns `Invalid Date`.\n *\n * @param {String} argument - the value to convert\n * @param {Object} [options] - an object with options.\n * @param {0|1|2} [options.additionalDigits=2] - the additional number of digits in the extended year format\n * @returns {Date} the parsed date in the local time zone\n * @throws {TypeError} 1 argument required\n * @throws {RangeError} `options.additionalDigits` must be 0, 1 or 2\n *\n * @example\n * // Convert string '2014-02-11T11:30:30' to date:\n * var result = parseISO('2014-02-11T11:30:30')\n * //=> Tue Feb 11 2014 11:30:30\n *\n * @example\n * // Convert string '+02014101' to date,\n * // if the additional number of digits in the extended year format is 1:\n * var result = parseISO('+02014101', { additionalDigits: 1 })\n * //=> Fri Apr 11 2014 00:00:00\n */\n\nexport default function parseISO(argument, dirtyOptions) {\n  requiredArgs(1, arguments);\n  var options = dirtyOptions || {};\n  var additionalDigits = options.additionalDigits == null ?

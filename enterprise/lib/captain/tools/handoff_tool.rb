  # TODO: Future enhancement - Add team assignment capability
  # This tool could be enhanced to:
  # 1. Accept team_id parameter for routing to specific teams
  # 2. Set conversation priority based on handoff reason
  # 3. Add metadata for intelligent agent assignment
  # 4. Support escalation levels (L1 -> L2 -> L3)
  #
  # Example future signature:
  # param :team_id, type: 'string', desc: 'ID of team to assign conversation to', required: false
  # param :priority, type: 'string', desc: 'Priority level (low/medium/high/urgent)', required: false
  # param :escalation_level, type: 'string', desc: 'Support level (L1/L2/L3)', required: false

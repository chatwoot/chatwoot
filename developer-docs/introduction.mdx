Welcome to the Chatwoot API documentation. Whether you're building custom workflows for your support team, integrating Chatwoot into your product, or managing users across installations, our APIs provide the flexibility and power to help you do more with Chatwoot.

Chatwoot provides three categories of APIs, each designed with a specific use case in mind:

- **Application APIs** – For account-level automation and agent-facing integrations.
- **Client APIs** – For building custom chat interfaces for end-users
- **Platform APIs** – For managing and administering installations at scale

---

## Application APIs

Application APIs are designed for interacting with a Chatwoot account from an agent/admin perspective. Use them to build internal tools, automate workflows, or perform bulk operations like data import/export.

- **Authentication**: Requires a user `access_token`, which can be generated from **Profile Settings** after logging into your Chatwoot account.
- **Availability**: Supported on both **Cloud** and **Self-hosted** Chatwoot installations.
- **Example**: [Google Cloud Functions Demo](https://github.com/chatwoot/google-cloud-functions-demo)

## Client APIs

Client APIs are intended for building custom messaging experiences over Chatwoot. If you're not using the native website widget or want to embed chat in your mobile app, these APIs are the way to go.

- **Authentication**: Uses `inbox_identifier` (from **Settings → Configuration** in API inboxes) and `contact_identifier` (returned when creating a contact).
- **Availability**: Supported on both **Cloud** and **Self-hosted** Chatwoot installations.
- **Examples**:

  - [Client API Demo](https://github.com/chatwoot/client-api-demo)
  - [Flutter SDK](https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot-flutter-sdk)

## Platform APIs

Platform APIs are used to manage Chatwoot installations at the admin level. These APIs allow you to control users, roles, and accounts, or sync data from external authentication systems.

- **Authentication**: Requires an `access_token` generated by a **Platform App**, which can be created in the **Super Admin Console**.
- **Availability**: Available on **Self-hosted** / **Managed Hosting** Chatwoot installations only.

Use the right API for your use case, and you'll be able to extend, customize, and integrate Chatwoot into your stack with ease.

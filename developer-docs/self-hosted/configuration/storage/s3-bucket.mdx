## Using Amazon S3

You can get started with [Creating an S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) and [Create an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) to configure the following details.

Configure the following env variables.

```bash
ACTIVE_STORAGE_SERVICE='amazon'
S3_BUCKET_NAME=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_REGION=
```

## S3 Bucket policy

Inorder to use S3 bucket in Chatwoot, a policy has to be set with the correct credentials. A sample policy is given below, as the listed actions are required for the storage to work.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "Policyxxx",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmtxxx",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "your-user-arn"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
            ]

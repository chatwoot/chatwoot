# Configure Cloud Storage

Chatwoot uses [Active Storage](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html) for storing attachments. The default storage option is local storage on your server, but you can configure cloud providers for better scalability and backup.

<Tip>
It is recommended to use a cloud provider for your Chatwoot storage to ensure proper backup of stored attachments and prevent data loss.
</Tip>

## Using Amazon S3

You can get started with [Creating an S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) and [Create an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) to configure the following details.

Configure the following env variables.

```bash
ACTIVE_STORAGE_SERVICE=amazon
S3_BUCKET_NAME=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_REGION=
```

## Using Google GCS

<Note>
Starting with version 2.17+, wrap the `GCS_CREDENTIALS` environment variable in single quotes.
</Note>

Configure the following env variables.

```bash
ACTIVE_STORAGE_SERVICE=google
GCS_PROJECT=
GCS_CREDENTIALS=
GCS_BUCKET=
```

The value of the `GCS_CREDENTIALS` should be a json formatted string containing the following keys.

```bash
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id" : "",
  "private_key_id" : "",
  "private_key" : "",
  "client_email" : "",
  "client_id" : "",
  "auth_uri" : "",
  "token_uri" : "",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url" : "",
  "client_x509_cert_url" : ""
}
```
When pasting the credentials to the ENV file, make sure to remove the new lines and paste it into a single line.

```bash
GCS_CREDENTIALS={"type": "service_account","project_id": "","private_key_id": "","private_key": "","client_email": "","client_id": "","auth_uri": "","token_uri": "","auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "","client_x509_cert_url": ""}
```

## Using Microsoft Azure

Configure the following env variables.

```bash
ACTIVE_STORAGE_SERVICE=microsoft
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER=
```

## Using Amazon S3 Compatible Service

To use an s3 compatible service such as [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/spaces/resources/s3-sdk-examples/#configure-a-client), Minio etc..

Configure the following env variables.

```bash
ACTIVE_STORAGE_SERVICE=s3_compatible
STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=
STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
STORAGE_REGION=nyc3
STORAGE_ENDPOINT=https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
#set force_path_style to true if using minio
#STORAGE_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true
```

Copy the json file content and set it as GCS_CREDENTIALS

A sample credential file is of the following format.

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "",
  "private_key_id": "",
  "private_key": "",
  "client_email": "",
  "client_id": "",
  "auth_uri": "",
  "token_uri": "",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "",
  "client_x509_cert_url": ""
}
```

When pasting the credentials to the ENV file, make sure to remove the new lines and paste it into a single line. 
```bash
GCS_CREDENTIALS={"type": "service_account","project_id": "","private_key_id": "","private_key": "","client_email": "","client_id": "","auth_uri": "","token_uri": "","auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "","client_x509_cert_url": ""}
```

<Note>
Email channels require [conversation continuity configured](/docs/self-hosted/configuration/features/email-channel/conversation-continuity)
</Note>

1. Enable `channel_email` (Login to rails console and execute the following)

```bash
account = Account.find(1)
account.enabled_features // This would list enabled features.
account.enable_features('channel_email')
account.save!
```

2. Now head over to inboxes page and create an email inbox with the support email as care@your-domain.com

### Sendgrid

You can send out emails only from a verified email address in SendGrid. For sending emails from wildcard domain, do verification at domain level instead of individual email.

### Testing On Local

You can visit `http://localhost:3000/rails/conductor/action_mailbox/inbound_emails/new` to send inbound mails from local to chatwoot inbox.

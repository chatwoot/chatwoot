1. Navigate to *Clusters* in the left-hand navigation menu.
2. Select the *Credentials* tab.
3. Click *Add credential*.

## One-click cluster creation with Restack

<Tip>
Why do I need a cluster?<br/>
Running your application on a Kubernetes cluster lets you deploy, scale and monitor the application reliably.
</Tip>

Once you have added your credentials,

1. Navigate to the *Clusters* tab on the same page and click on *Create cluster*.

2. Give a suitable name to your cluster.
3. Select the region you want to deploy the cluster in.
4. Select the AWS credentials you added in the previous step.

The cluster creation process will start automatically. Once the cluster is ready, you will get an email on the email id connected with your account.<br/>Creating a cluster is a one-time process. From here you can add other open source tools or multiple instances of Chatwoot in the same cluster.

## Deploy multiple instances of Chatwoot

Restack makes it easier to deploy multiple instances of Chatwoot on the same or multiple clusters.<br/>So you can test the latest version before upgrading or have a dedicated instance for development and for production.

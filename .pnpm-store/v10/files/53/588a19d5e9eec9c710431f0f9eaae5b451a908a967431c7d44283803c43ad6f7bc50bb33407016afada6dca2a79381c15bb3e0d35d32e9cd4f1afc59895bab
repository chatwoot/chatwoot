### Based on my [article](https://dev.to/tomaszbujnowicz/setup-tailwind-css-in-20-seconds-without-nodemodules-1b83)

Tired of running `npm install / yarn` and seeing tons of files installed in your node_modules just to process your Tailwind CSS file? I got you, have a look at this minimal approach.

### Quick start: Installation

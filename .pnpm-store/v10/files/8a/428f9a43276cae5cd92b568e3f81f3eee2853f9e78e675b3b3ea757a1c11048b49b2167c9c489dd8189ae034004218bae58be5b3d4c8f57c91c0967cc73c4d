00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.951
At the left we can see...

2
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.083
At the right we can see the...

3
00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.962
...the head-snarlers

4
00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.368
Everything is safe.
Perfectly safe.

5
00:00:24.582 --> 00:00:27.035
Emo?

6
00:00:28.206 --> 00:00:29.996
Watch out!

7
00:00:47.037 --> 00:00:48.494
Are you hurt?

8
00:00:51.994 --> 00:00:53.949
I don't think so.
You?

9
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.985
I'm Ok.

10
00:00:57.118 --> 00:01:01.111
Get up.
Emo. it's not safe here.

11
00:01:02.034 --> 00:01:03.573
Let's go.

12
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.114
What's next?

13
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.146
You'll see!

14
00:01:16.032 --> 00:01:18.022
Emo.
This way.

15
00:01:34.237 --> 00:01:35.481
Follow me!

16
00:02:11.106 --> 00:02:12.480
Hurry Emo!

17
00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:49.930
You're not paying attention!

18
00:02:50.142 --> 00:02:54.052
I just want to answer the...
...phone.

19
00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:57.972
Emo. look.
I mean listen.

20
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.008
You have to learn to listen.

21
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.965
This is not some game.

22
00:03:05.056 --> 00:03:09.345
You. I mean we.
we could easily die out here.

23
00:03:10.014 --> 00:03:13.959
Listen.
listen to the sounds of the machine.

24
00:03:18.054 --> 00:03:20.009
Listen to your breathing.

25
00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:28.956
Well. don't you ever get tired of this?

26
00:04:29.084 --> 00:04:30.909
Tired?!?

27
00:04:31.126 --> 00:04:34.491
Emo. the machine is like clockwork.

28
00:04:35.083 --> 00:04:37.074
One move out of place...

29
00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:39.121
...and you're ground to a pulp.

30
00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.004
But isn't it -

31
00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:46.034
Pulp. Emo!
Is that what you want. pulp?

32
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.995
Emo. your goal in life...

33
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.953
...pulp?

34
00:05:41.156 --> 00:05:43.028
Emo. close your eyes.

35
00:05:44.156 --> 00:05:46.027
Why?
- Now!

36
00:05:51.155 --> 00:05:52.102
Ok.

37
00:05:53.113 --> 00:05:54.688
Good.

38
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.103
What do you see at your left side. Emo?

39
00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:05.899
Nothing.
- Really?

40
00:06:06.027 --> 00:06:07.105
No. nothing at all.

41
00:06:07.944 --> 00:06:11.984
And at your right.
what do you see at your right side. Emo?

42
00:06:13.151 --> 00:06:16.102
The same Proog. exactly the same...

43
00:06:16.942 --> 00:06:19.098
...nothing!
- Great.

44
00:06:40.105 --> 00:06:42.724
Listen Proog! Do you hear that!

45
00:06:43.105 --> 00:06:44.894
Can we go here?

46
00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:47.894
There?
It isn't safe. Emo.

47
00:06:49.145 --> 00:06:52.013
But...
- Trust me. it's not.

48
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.145
Maybe I could...

49
00:06:54.181 --> 00:06:55.969
No.

50
00:06:57.102 --> 00:06:59.934
NO!

51
00:07:00.144 --> 00:07:03.058
Any further questions. Emo?

52
00:07:03.976 --> 00:07:05.090
No.

53
00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:10.089
Emo?

54
00:07:11.142 --> 00:07:13.058
Emo. why...

55
00:07:13.095 --> 00:07:14.022
Emo...

56
00:07:14.058 --> 00:07:18.003
...why can't you see
the beauty of this place?

57
00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:20.048
The way it works.

58
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.895
How perfect it is.

59
00:07:23.932 --> 00:07:26.964
No. Proog. I don't see.

60
00:07:27.056 --> 00:07:29.970
I don't see because there's nothing there.

61
00:07:31.055 --> 00:07:34.965
And why should I trust my
life to something that isn't there?

62
00:07:35.055 --> 00:07:36.926
Well can you tell me that?

63
00:07:37.054 --> 00:07:38.926
Answer me!

64
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.000
Proog...

65
00:07:45.053 --> 00:07:46.985
...you're a sick man!

66
00:07:47.022 --> 00:07:48.918
Stay away from me!

67
00:07:52.052 --> 00:07:54.884
No! Emo! It's a trap!

68
00:07:55.135 --> 00:07:56.931
Hah. it's a trap.

69
00:07:56.968 --> 00:08:01.043
At the left side you can see
the hanging gardens of Babylon!

70
00:08:01.967 --> 00:08:03.957
How's that for a trap?

71
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.922
No. Emo.

72
00:08:09.008 --> 00:08:12.088
At the right side you can see...
...well guess what...

73
00:08:12.924 --> 00:08:14.665
...the colossus of Rhodes!

74
00:08:15.132 --> 00:08:16.053
No!

75
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:21.919
The colossus of Rhodes
and it is here just for you Proog.

76
00:08:51.001 --> 00:08:52.923
It is there...

77
00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:56.040
I'm telling you.
Emo...

78
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.867
...it is.

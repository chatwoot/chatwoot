    The buffer or buffer cursor to read the node data from.
    
    When this is an array, it should contain four values for every
    node in the tree.
    
     - The first holds the node's type, as a node ID pointing into
       the given `NodeSet`.
     - The second holds the node's start offset.
     - The third the end offset.
     - The fourth the amount of space taken up in the array by this
       node and its children. Since there's four values per node,
       this is the total number of nodes inside this node (children
       and transitive children) plus one for the node itself, times
       four.
    
    Parent nodes should appear _after_ child nodes in the array. As
    an example, a node of type 10 spanning positions 0 to 4, with
    two children, of type 11 and 12, might look like this:
    
        [11, 0, 1, 4, 12, 2, 4, 4, 10, 0, 4, 12]

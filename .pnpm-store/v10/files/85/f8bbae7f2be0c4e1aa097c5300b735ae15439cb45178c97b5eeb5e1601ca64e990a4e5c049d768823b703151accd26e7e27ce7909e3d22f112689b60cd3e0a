This is a [schema module](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#schema-list) for [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net).
ProseMirror is a well-behaved rich semantic content editor based on
contentEditable, with support for collaborative editing and custom
document schemas.

This [module](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#schema-list) exports
schema elements and commands for including lists in a ProseMirror
editor.

The [project page](https://prosemirror.net) has more information, a
number of [examples](https://prosemirror.net/examples/) and the
[documentation](https://prosemirror.net/docs/).

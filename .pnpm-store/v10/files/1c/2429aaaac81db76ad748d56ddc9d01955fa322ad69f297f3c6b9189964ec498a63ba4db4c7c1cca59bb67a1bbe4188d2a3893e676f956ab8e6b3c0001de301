Thank you, [@bulandent](https://github.com/bulandent), for your contributions


## [0.7.9](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/compare/0.7.8...0.7.9)

### Fixed

- Properly check nodes before replacement [`#457`](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/pull/457) / [`#455`](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/issues/455) / [`#456`](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/issues/456)

Thank you, [@edemaine](https://github.com/edemaine), [@pedro-l9](https://github.com/pedro-l9), for your contributions


## [0.7.8](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/compare/0.7.7...0.7.8)

### Fixed

- fix: Restore ES5 compatibility [`#452`](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/pull/452) / [`#453`](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/issues/453)

Thank you, [@fengxinming](https://github.com/fengxinming), for your contributions


## [0.7.7](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/compare/0.7.6...0.7.7)

### Fixed

- Security: Prevent inserting DOM nodes when they are not well-formed [`CVE-2022-39353`](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/security/advisories/GHSA-crh6-fp67-6883)
  In case such a DOM would be created, the part that is not well-formed will be transformed into text nodes, in which xml specific characters like `<` and `>` are encoded accordingly.
  In the upcoming version 0.9.0 those text nodes will no longer be added and an error will be thrown instead.
  This change can break your code, if you relied on this behavior, e.g. multiple root elements in the past. We consider it more important to align with the specs that we want to be aligned with, considering the potential security issues that might derive from people not being aware of the difference in behavior.

## 0.5.0

[Commits](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/compare/0.4.0...0.5.0)

### Fixes
- Avoid misinterpretation of malicious XML input - [`GHSA-h6q6-9hqw-rwfv`](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/security/advisories/GHSA-h6q6-9hqw-rwfv) (CVE-2021-21366)
  - Improve error reporting; throw on duplicate attribute\
    BREAKING CHANGE: It is currently not clear how to consistently deal with duplicate attributes, so it's also safer for our users to fail when detecting them.
    It's possible to configure the `DOMParser.errorHandler` before parsing, to handle those errors differently.

    To accomplish this and also be able to verify it in tests I needed to
    - create a new `Error` type `ParseError` and export it
    - Throw `ParseError` from `errorHandler.fatalError` and prevent those from being caught in `XMLReader`.
    - export `DOMHandler` constructor as `__DOMHandler`
  - Preserve quotes in DOCTYPE declaration
    Since the only purpose of parsing the DOCTYPE is to be able to restore it when serializing, we decided that it would be best to leave the parsed `publicId` and `systemId` as is, including any quotes.
    BREAKING CHANGE: If somebody relies on the actual unquoted values of those ids, they will need to take care of either single or double quotes and the right escaping.
    (Without this change this would not have been possible because the SAX parser already dropped the information about the quotes that have been used in the source.)

## 0.1.31

[Commits](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/compare/v0.1.27...v0.1.31)

The patch versions (`v0.1.29` - `v0.1.31`) that have been released on the [v0.1.x branch](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/tree/0.1.x), to reflect the changed maintainers, **are branched off from [`v0.1.27`](#0127) so they don't include the breaking changes introduced in [`xmldom-alpha@v0.1.28`](#0128)**:

## Maintainer changes

After the last commit to the original repository <https://github.com/jindw/xmldom> on the 9th of May 2017, the first commit to <https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom> is from the 19th of December 2019. [The fork has been announced in the original repository on the 2nd of March 2020.](https://github.com/jindw/xmldom/issues/259)

The versions listed below have been published to one or both of the following packages:
- <https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmldom-alpha>
- <https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmldom>

It is currently not planned to continue publishing the `xmldom-alpha` package.

The new maintainers did not invest time to understand changes that led to the last `xmldom` version [`0.1.27`](#0127) published by the original maintainer, but consider it the basis for their work.
A timeline of all the changes that happened from that version until `0.3.0` is available in <https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/issues/62>. Any related questions should be asked there.

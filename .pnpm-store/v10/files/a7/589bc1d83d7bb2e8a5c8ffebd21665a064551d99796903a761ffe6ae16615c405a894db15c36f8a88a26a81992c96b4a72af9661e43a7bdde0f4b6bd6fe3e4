{{alias}}( obj, prop, descriptor )
    Defines (or modifies) an object property.

    Property descriptors come in two flavors: data descriptors and accessor
    descriptors. A data descriptor is a property that has a value, which may or
    may not be writable. An accessor descriptor is a property described by a
    getter-setter function pair. A descriptor must be one of these two flavors
    and cannot be both.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj: Object
        Object on which to define the property.

    prop: string|symbol
        Property name.

    descriptor: Object
        Property descriptor.

    descriptor.configurable: boolean (optional)
        Boolean indicating if property descriptor can be changed and if the
        property can be deleted from the provided object. Default: false.

    descriptor.enumerable: boolean (optional)
        Boolean indicating if the property shows up when enumerating object
        properties. Default: false.

    descriptor.writable: boolean (optional)
        Boolean indicating if the value associated with the property can be
        changed with an assignment operator. Default: false.

    descriptor.value: any (optional)
        Property value.

    descriptor.get: Function|void (optional)
        Function which serves as a getter for the property, or, if no getter,
        undefined. When the property is accessed, a getter function is called
        without arguments and with the `this` context set to the object through
        which the property is accessed (which may not be the object on which the
        property is defined due to inheritance). The return value will be used
        as the property value. Default: undefined.

    descriptor.set: Function|void (optional)
        Function which serves as a setter for the property, or, if no setter,
        undefined. When assigning a property value, a setter function is called
        with one argument (the value being assigned to the property) and with
        the `this` context set to the object through which the property is
        assigned. Default: undefined.

    Returns
    -------
    obj: Object
        Object on which the property was defined (or modified).

    Examples
    --------
    > var obj = {};
    > {{alias}}( obj, 'foo', {
    ...     'value': 'bar',
    ...     'enumerable': true,
    ...     'writable': false
    ... });
    > obj.foo = 'boop';
    > obj
    { 'foo': 'bar' }

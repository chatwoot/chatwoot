{{alias}}( value )
    Tests if a value is object-like.

    Return values are the same as would be obtained using the built-in `typeof`
    operator except that `null` is not considered an object.

    value: any
        Value to test.

    Returns
    -------
    bool: boolean
        Boolean indicating whether value is object-like.

    Examples
    --------
    > var bool = {{alias}}( {} )
    true
    > bool = {{alias}}( [] )
    true
    > bool = {{alias}}( null )

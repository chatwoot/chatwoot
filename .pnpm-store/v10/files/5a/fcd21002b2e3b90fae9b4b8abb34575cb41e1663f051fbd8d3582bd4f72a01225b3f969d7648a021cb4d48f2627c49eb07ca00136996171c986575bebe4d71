 * Checks whether or not we've already captured the given exception (note: not an identical exception - the very object
 * in question), and marks it captured if not.
 *
 * This is useful because it's possible for an error to get captured by more than one mechanism. After we intercept and
 * record an error, we rethrow it (assuming we've intercepted it before it's reached the top-level global handlers), so
 * that we don't interfere with whatever effects the error might have had were the SDK not there. At that point, because
 * the error has been rethrown, it's possible for it to bubble up to some other code we've instrumented. If it's not
 * caught after that, it will bubble all the way up to the global handlers (which of course we also instrument). This
 * function helps us ensure that even if we encounter the same error more than once, we only record it the first time we
 * see it.
 *
 * Note: It will ignore primitives (always return `false` and not mark them as seen), as properties can't be set on
 * them. {@link: Object.objectify} can be used on exceptions to convert any that are primitives into their equivalent
 * object wrapper forms so that this check will always work. However, because we need to flag the exact object which
 * will get rethrown, and because that rethrowing happens outside of the event processing pipeline, the objectification
 * must be done before the exception captured.
 *
 * @param A thrown exception to check or flag as having been seen
 * @returns `true` if the exception has already been captured, `false` if not (with the side effect of marking it seen)

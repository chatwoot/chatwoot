# @breezystack/lamejs

This is a fork from <https://github.com/zhuker/lamejs>.

You can check the README of the original repository to learn about its functions and usage.

The lamejs package originally published on npmjs is not the latest version of github main branch, and it may report an [ReferenceError: MPEGMode is not defined](https://github.com/zhuker/lamejs/issues/91)

The original version also does not provide esmodule and Typescript definition support, which makes it troublesome for developers in some newer projects.

This forked version is published on npmjs as `@breezystack/lamejs`, and it is the latest version of github main branch.

It also provides esmodule and very brief Typescript definition support.

At the same time, support for the bower was removed.

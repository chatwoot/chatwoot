/**
 * Mobile browsers do not support `mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia` even though they have the api implemented
 * Instead they return things like `NotAllowedError` when called.
 *
 * It's simpler for us to browser sniff first, and avoid loading the integration if we can.

 *
 * `mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia` is also only supported in secure contexts, and return a `mediaDevices is not supported` error, so we should also avoid loading the integration if we can.

# Youtube Analytics.js Plugin

Automatically track Youtube video player events as Segment events.

## Installation

The plugin is distributed as both an NPM package and as a direct export via a CDN.

### CDN

Simply add the following script tag to the `head` of your site. `YoutubeAnalytics` will be available as part of the global `window.analyticsPlugins` object.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@segment/youtube-analytics@1/dist/youtube.min.js"></script>
```
> The above url will download the minified version of the plugin. Donâ€™t use this version during development! You will miss out on all the nice warnings for common mistakes! To access the unminified version, simply replace `youtube.min.js` with `youtube.js`

### NPM

```bash
# latest stable
$ npm install @segment/youtube-analytics
```

## Initializing

To initialize the plugin you will need to give it access to the Youtube video player instance(s) running on your page within the Youtube `onYouTubeIframeAPIReady()` function (more information on that [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Loading_a_Video_Player). This is done using the `initialize` method:

```javascript
var player;
var apiKey = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';
function onYouTubeIframeAPIReady() {
    player = new YT.Player('player', {
    height: '390',
    width: '640',
    videoId: 'M7lc1UVf-VE'
    });
    var ytAnalytics = new window.videoPlugins.YouTubeAnalytics(player, apiKey);
    ytAnalytics.initialize();
}
```

The plugin will now begin listening for the Youtube player lifecycle events and responding to them with Segment video events.

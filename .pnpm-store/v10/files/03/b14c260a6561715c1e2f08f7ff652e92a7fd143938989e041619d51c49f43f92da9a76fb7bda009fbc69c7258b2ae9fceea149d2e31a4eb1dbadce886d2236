This is a plugin that adds a type of selection for focusing places
that don't allow regular selection (such as positions that have a leaf
block node, table, or the end of the document both before and after
them).

You'll probably want to load `style/gapcursor.css`, which contains
basic styling for the simulated cursor (as a short, blinking
horizontal stripe).

By default, gap cursor are only allowed in places where the default
content node (in the schema content constraints) is a textblock node.
You can customize this by adding an `allowGapCursor` property to your
node specsâ€”if it's true, gap cursor are allowed everywhere in that
node, if it's `false` they are never allowed.

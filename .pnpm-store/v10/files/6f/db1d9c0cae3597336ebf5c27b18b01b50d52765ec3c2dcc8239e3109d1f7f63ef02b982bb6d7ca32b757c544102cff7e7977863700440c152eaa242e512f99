These are just for backwards compatibility with fake-indexeddb v3 and earlier.

The .js files are for things that don't understand the package.json exports field, such as Jest 27 and earlier.

The .d.ts files are here for the same reason, but are additionally used by things reading the package.json exports field too, since TypeScript 4.6 and earlier don't support specifying types in exports.

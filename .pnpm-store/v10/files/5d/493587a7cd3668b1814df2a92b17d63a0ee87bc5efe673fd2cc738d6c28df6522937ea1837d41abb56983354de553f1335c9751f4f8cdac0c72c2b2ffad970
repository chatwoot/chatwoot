     * - `drop-error-if-contains-third-party-frames`: Drop error events that contain at least one third-party stack frame.
     * - `drop-error-if-exclusively-contains-third-party-frames`: Drop error events that exclusively contain third-party stack frames.
     * - `apply-tag-if-contains-third-party-frames`: Keep all error events, but apply a `third_party_code: true` tag in case the error contains at least one third-party stack frame.
     * - `apply-tag-if-exclusively-contains-third-party-frames`: Keep all error events, but apply a `third_party_code: true` tag in case the error contains exclusively third-party stack frames.
     *
     * If you chose the mode to only apply tags, the tags can then be used in Sentry to filter your issue stream by entering `!third_party_code:True` in the search bar.

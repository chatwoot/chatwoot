## 6.10.0 (2023-12-28)

### New features

The new `bidiIsolates` extension can be used to wrap syntactic elements where this is appropriate in an element that isolates their text direction, avoiding weird ordering of neutral characters on direction boundaries.

## 6.9.3 (2023-11-27)

### Bug fixes

Fix an issue in `StreamLanguage` where it ran out of node type ids if you repeatedly redefined a language with the same token table.

Make `getIndentation` return null, rather than 0, when there is no syntax tree available.

## 0.20.1 (2022-05-18)

## 0.20.0 (2022-04-20)

### Breaking changes

`HighlightStyle.get` is now called `highlightingFor`.

`HighlightStyles` no longer function as extensions (to improve tree shaking), and must be wrapped with `syntaxHighlighting` to add to an editor configuration.

`Language` objects no longer have a `topNode` property.

### New features

`HighlightStyle` and `defaultHighlightStyle` from the now-removed @codemirror/highlight package now live in this package.

The new `forceParsing` function can be used to run the parser forward on an editor view.

The exports that used to live in @codemirror/matchbrackets are now exported from this package.

Fix an issue where the parse worker could incorrectly stop working when the parse tree has skipped gaps in it.

## 0.19.6 (2021-11-26)

### Bug fixes

Fixes an issue where the background parse work would be scheduled too aggressively, degrading responsiveness on a newly-created editor with a large document.

Improve initial highlight for mixed-language editors and limit the amount of parsing done on state creation for faster startup.

## 0.19.5 (2021-11-17)

### New features

The new function `syntaxTreeAvailable` can be used to check if a fully-parsed syntax tree is available up to a given document position.

### Bug fixes

Fix incorrect versions for @lezer dependencies.

## 0.19.0 (2021-08-11)

### Breaking changes

CodeMirror now uses lezer 0.15, which means different package names (scoped with @lezer) and some breaking changes in the library.

`EditorParseContext` is now called `ParseContext`. It is no longer passed to parsers, but must be retrieved with `ParseContext.get`.

`IndentContext.lineIndent` now takes a position, not a `Line` object, as argument.

`LezerLanguage` was renamed to `LRLanguage` (because all languages must emit Lezer-style trees, the name was misleading).

`Language.parseString` no longer exists. You can just call `.parser.parse(...)` instead.

### New features

New `IndentContext.lineAt` method to access lines in a way that is aware of simulated line breaks.

`IndentContext` now provides a `simulatedBreak` property through which client code can query whether the context has a simulated line break.

The `Language` constructor takes an additional argument that provides the top node type.

### New features

`Language` instances now have a `topNode` property giving their top node type.

`TreeIndentContext` now has a `continue` method that allows an indenter to defer to the indentation of the parent nodes.

## 0.17.5 (2021-02-19)

### New features

This package now exports a `foldInside` helper function, a fold function that should work for most delimited node types.

## 0.17.4 (2021-01-15)

## 0.17.3 (2021-01-15)

### Bug fixes

Parse scheduling has been improved to reduce the likelyhood of the user looking at unparsed code in big documents.

The package now also exports a CommonJS module.

## Contributing Docs

All the documentation files can be found in `packages/docs`. It contains the English markdown files while translation(s) are stored in their corresponding `<lang>` sub-folder(s):

- [`fr`](https://github.com/vuejs/test-utils/tree/main/packages/docs/fr): French translation.

Besides that, the `.vitepress` sub-folder contains the config and theme, including the i18n information.

- `pnpm docs:dev`: Start the docs dev server.
- `pnpm docs:build`: Build the docs.

To add or maintain the translations, we follow the [Vue Ecosystem Translation Guidelines](https://github.com/vuejs-translations/guidelines/blob/main/README_ECOSYSTEM.md).

- `pnpm docs:translation:status [<lang>]`: Show the translation status for your language. If you don't specify a language, it will show the status for all languages.
- `pnpm docs:translation:compare <lang>`: Compare the docs with the latest checkpoint for your language.
- `pnpm docs:translation:update <lang> [<commit>]`: Update the checkpoint for your language. The checkpoint will be set by the latest commit hash. However, you can also specify a commit hash manually.

title: Customizing Dashboards
---

In order to customize which attributes get displayed for each resource,
edit the dashboard file generated by the installation generator.

By default, the file will look something like this:

```ruby
require "administrate/base_dashboard"

class CustomerDashboard < Administrate::BaseDashboard
  ATTRIBUTE_TYPES = {
    id: Field::Number,
    name: Field::String,
    email: Field::String,
    created_at: Field::DateTime,
    updated_at: Field::DateTime,
    orders: Field::HasMany,
  }

  COLLECTION_ATTRIBUTES = [
    :id,
    :name,
    :email,
    :created_at,
    :updated_at,
    :orders,
  ]

  SHOW_PAGE_ATTRIBUTES = [
    :id,
    :name,
    :email,
    :created_at,
    :updated_at,
    :orders,
  ]

  FORM_ATTRIBUTES = [
    :name,
    :email,
    :orders,
  ]
end
```

To change which attributes appear on each of the `index`, `show`, and `edit`
pages, add or remove attributes to each constant array.

Finally, the `ATTRIBUTE_TYPES` method defines how each attribute is displayed
throughout the dashboard. There are a number of `Field` classes that you can
specify, including:

- `Field::BelongsTo`
- `Field::Boolean`
- `Field::DateTime`
- `Field::Date`
- `Field::Email`
- `Field::HasMany`
- `Field::HasOne`
- `Field::Number`
- `Field::Polymorphic`
- `Field::Select`
- `Field::String`
- `Field::Text`
- `Field::Url`
- `Field::Password`

## Customizing Fields

### Setting Options

Each of the `Field` types take a different set of options,
which are specified through the `.with_options` class method:

**Field::BelongsTo**

`:order` - Specifies the column used to order the records. It will apply both in
the table views and in the dropdown menu on the record forms.
You can set multiple columns as well with direction. E.g.: `"name, email DESC"`.

`:scope` - Specifies a custom scope inside a callable. Useful for preloading.
Example: `.with_options(scope: -> { MyModel.includes(:rel).limit(5) })`

`:include_blank` - Specifies if the select element to be rendered should include
blank option. Default is `true`.

`:searchable` - Specify if the attribute should be considered when searching.
Default is `false`.

`searchable_fields` - Specify which columns to use on the search, only applies
if `searchable` is `true`

For example:

```ruby
  country: Field::BelongsTo.with_options(
    searchable: true,
    searchable_fields: ['name'],
  )
```

with this, you will be able to search through the column `name` from the
association `belongs_to :country`, from your model.

`:primary_key` (deprecated) - Specifies the association's primary_key.

`:foreign_key` (deprecated) - Specifies the name of the foreign key directly.

`:class_name` (deprecated) - Specifies the name of the associated class.

**Field::HasMany**

`:collection_attributes` - Set the columns to display in the show view. 
Default is COLLECTION_ATTRIBUTES in dashboard.

`:limit` - The number of resources (paginated) to display in the show view. To disable pagination,
set this to `0` or `false`. Default is `5`.

`:sort_by` - What to sort the association by in the show view.

`:direction` - What direction the sort should be in, `:asc` (default) or `:desc`.

`:primary_key` (deprecated) - Specifies object's primary_key.

`:foreign_key` (deprecated) - Specifies the name of the foreign key directly.

`:class_name` (deprecated) - Specifies the name of the associated class.

**Field::HasOne**

`:order` - Specifies the column used to order the records. It will apply both in
the table views and in the dropdown menu on the record forms.
You can set multiple columns as well with direction. E.g.: `"name, email DESC"`.

`:searchable` - Specify if the attribute should be considered when searching.
Default is `false`.

`searchable_fields` - Specify which columns to use on the search, only applies if
`searchable` is `true`

For example:

```ruby
  cities: Field::HasMany.with_options(
    searchable: true,
    searchable_fields: ['name'],
  )
```

with this, you will be able to search through the column `name` from the
association `has_many :cities`, from your model.

`:class_name` (deprecated) - Specifies the name of the associated class.

**Field::Number**

`:searchable` - Specify if the attribute should be considered when searching.
Note that currently number fields are searched like text, which may yield
more results than expected. Default is `false`.

`:decimals` - Set the number of decimals to display. Defaults to `0`.

`:prefix` - Prefixes the number with a string. Defaults to `""`.

`:suffix` - Suffixes the number with a string. Defaults to `""`.

`:format` - Specify a hash which defines a formatter. This uses ActiveSupport
and works by  by passing a hash that includes the formatter (`formatter`) and
the options for the formatter (`formatter_options`). Defaults to the locale's
delimiter when `formatter_options` does not include a `delimiter`. See the
example below. All helpers from `ActiveSupport::NumberHelper` are supported.

For example, you might use the following to display U.S. currency:

```ruby
  unit_price: Field::Number.with_options(
    prefix: "$",
    decimals: 2,
  )

  # "$5.99"
```

Or, to display a distance in kilometers, using a space as the delimiter:

```ruby
  distance: Field::Number.with_options(
    suffix: " km",
    decimals: 2,
    format: {
        formatter: :number_to_delimited,
        formatter_options: {
            delimiter: ' ',
        },
    },
  )

  # "2 000.00 km"
```

**Field::Polymorphic**

`:classes` - Specify a list of classes whose objects will be used to populate select boxes for editing this polymorphic field.
Default is `[]`.

`:order` - What to sort the association by in the form select.
Default is `nil`.

**Field::DateTime**

`:format` - Specify what format, using `strftime` you would like `DateTime`
objects to display as.

`:timezone` - Specify which timezone `Date` and `DateTime` objects are based
in.

**Field::Date**

`:format` - Specify what format, using `strftime` you would like `Date`
objects to display as.

**Field::Select**

`:collection` - The options available to select. The format is the same as for Rails's own [`options_for_select`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormOptionsHelper.html#method-i-options_for_select).

If the given value responds to `call`, this will be called and the result used instead. The call will receive an instance of the field as argument. For example:

```ruby
  confirmation: Field::Select.with_options(
    collection: ->(field) {
      person = field.resource
      {
        "no, #{person.name}" => "opt0",
        "yes, #{person.name}" => "opt1",
        "absolutely, #{person.name}" => "opt2",
      }
    },
  )
```

Administrate will detect if the attribute is an `ActiveRecord::Enum` and extract the available options. Note that if a `collection` is provided it will take precedence.

If no collection is provided and no enum can be detected, the list of options will be empty.

`:searchable` - Specify if the attribute should be considered when searching.
Default is `true`.

`:include_blank` - Similar to [the option of the same name accepted by Rails helpers](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormOptionsHelper.html). If provided, a "blank" option will be added first to the list of options, with the value of `include_blank` as label.

**Field::String**

`:searchable` - Specify if the attribute should be considered when searching.
Default is `true`.

`:truncate` - Set the number of characters to display in the index view.
Defaults to `50`.

**Field::Text**

`:searchable` - Specify if the attribute should be considered when searching.
Default is `false`.

`:truncate` - Set the number of characters to display in the index view.
Defaults to `50`.

**Field::Url**

`:searchable` - Specify if the attribute should be considered when searching.
Default is `true`.

`:truncate` - Set the number of characters to display in the index view.
Defaults to `50`.

`:html_options` - Specify anchor tag attributes (e.g., `target="_blank"`).
Defaults is `{}`.

**Field::Password**

`:searchable` - Specify if the attribute should be considered when searching.
Default is `false`.

`:truncate` - Set the number of characters to display in the views.
Defaults to `50`.

`:character` - Set the replace character.
Defaults to `•`.

### Defining Labels

To change the user-facing label for an attribute,
define a custom I18n translation:

```yaml
en:
  helpers:
    label:
      customer:
        name: Full Name
```


To change the labels used for resources in dashboard collections.
Assume you have a users dashboard and you want to change "User #1" to "Testy
McTesterson", the user's name.

Add this method to the dashboard for Users.
Use whatever attribute or method you like.
Example for *user*:

```ruby
def display_resource(user)
  user.name
end
```

[define your own]: /adding_custom_field_types

To change the dashboard name in sidebar menu, sub-header and search string use default ActiveRecord i18n translations for models:

```yaml
en:
  activerecord:
    models:
      customer:
        one: Happy Customer
        other: Happy Customers
```

## Collection Filters

Resources can be filtered with pre-set filters. For example if we added:

```ruby
COLLECTION_FILTERS = {
  inactive: ->(resources) { resources.where("login_at < ?", 1.week.ago) }
}
```

…to a dashboard, we can query the resources of that dashboard with:

```ruby
bob inactive:
```

…to find users named "bob" who hasn't logged in the last week.

If you already had the `inactive` scope you could define the filter like so to
take advantage of existing ActiveRecord scopes (and other class methods on the
resource class).

```ruby
COLLECTION_FILTERS = {
  inactive: ->(resources) { resources.inactive }
}
```

You can also define a filter with parameters:

```ruby
COLLECTION_FILTERS = {
  state: ->(resources, attr) { resources.where(state: attr) }
}
```

You can now search your resource with 'state:open' and your
collection filter Proc will be called with with attr = open.

## Form Attributes

You can define different attributes for new/create or edit/update actions:

```ruby
FORM_ATTRIBUTES_NEW = [
  :name,
  :email
]
FORM_ATTRIBUTES_EDIT = [
  :name,
  :email,
  :orders
]
```

Or for custom action with constant name `"FORM_ATTRIBUTES_#{action.upcase}"`

### Form Fields' Hints

You can show a brief text element below an input field by setting the
corresponding translation key using the path:

`administrate.field_hints.#{model_name}.#{field_name}`

For example, with a Customer dashboard with an email field you can add a
string value that will be used as text hint:

```yml
en:
  administrate:
    field_hints:
      customer:
        email: field_hint
```

## Grouped Attributes

You may have models with a large number of fields and therefore you might want to group them in a meaningul way:

```ruby
class UserDashboard < Administrate::BaseDashboard
  SHOW_PAGE_ATTRIBUTES = {
    "" => [:username],
    "Personal Information" => [:first_name, :last_name, :email],
    "Address" => [:address_line_one, :address_line_two, :address_city, :address_state, :address_country]
  }

  FORM_ATTRIBUTES = {
    "" => [:username, :password, :password_confirmation],
    "personal_information" => [:first_name, :last_name, :email],
    "address" => [:address_line_one, :address_line_two, :address_city, :address_state, :address_country]
  }
end
```

You can optionally translate your group labels:

```yaml
en:
  helpers:
    label:
      user:
        address: Address
        personal_information: Personal Information
```

If not defined (see `SHOW_PAGE_ATTRIBUTES` above), Administrate will default to the given strings.

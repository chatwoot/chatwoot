== 0.6.0 2010-10-25 - The Multi-ORM/Connection Release

This release has the often asked for functionality of being able to clean
multiple databases within the same project.  This involves being able to
clean databases managed by the same ORM (i.e. different connections) and
also being able to clean databases managed by distinct ORMs.  So, for
example you can now use DatabaseCleaner on a project that has ActiveRecord
and Mongoid to help ensure all DBs all in a clean state.  Please see the
README for more information.  The old API has been preserved so this release
is backwards compatible.

This release is a result of Jon Rowe's hard work. Many thanks to Jon for all
of the hours and effort he put into making this feature request a reality.

=== New Features

  * Ability to clean multiple database connections managed by the same ORM. (Jon Rowe)
  * Ability to clean multiple DBs managed by different ORMs in same project. (Jon Rowe)

=== Bugfixes

  * Removes extraneous puts call from configuration.rb.  (Ben Mabey)

== 0.5.1 - The Mongoid Release

This release also attempts to fix AR for Rails 3 support.  I have seen mixed reviews on this.  Some people
claim the fixes allow for use in Rails3 while others have not had good luck with it.  I plan on reworking
the way AR support is added so that it is more friendly with how Rails 3 uses autoload.

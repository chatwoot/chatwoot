    # A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented
    # as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond
    # resolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts like "day"
    # or "month". It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between
    # two Timestamp values is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted
    # from a Timestamp. Range is approximately +-10,000 years.
    #
    # # Examples
    #
    # Example 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.
    #
    #     Timestamp start = ...;
    #     Timestamp end = ...;
    #     Duration duration = ...;
    #
    #     duration.seconds = end.seconds - start.seconds;
    #     duration.nanos = end.nanos - start.nanos;
    #
    #     if (duration.seconds < 0 && duration.nanos > 0) {
    #       duration.seconds += 1;
    #       duration.nanos -= 1000000000;
    #     } else if (duration.seconds > 0 && duration.nanos < 0) {
    #       duration.seconds -= 1;
    #       duration.nanos += 1000000000;
    #     }
    #
    # Example 2: Compute Timestamp from Timestamp + Duration in pseudo code.
    #
    #     Timestamp start = ...;
    #     Duration duration = ...;
    #     Timestamp end = ...;
    #
    #     end.seconds = start.seconds + duration.seconds;
    #     end.nanos = start.nanos + duration.nanos;
    #
    #     if (end.nanos < 0) {
    #       end.seconds -= 1;
    #       end.nanos += 1000000000;
    #     } else if (end.nanos >= 1000000000) {
    #       end.seconds += 1;
    #       end.nanos -= 1000000000;
    #     }
    #
    # Example 3: Compute Duration from datetime.timedelta in Python.
    #
    #     td = datetime.timedelta(days=3, minutes=10)
    #     duration = Duration()
    #     duration.FromTimedelta(td)
    #
    # # JSON Mapping
    #
    # In JSON format, the Duration type is encoded as a string rather than an
    # object, where the string ends in the suffix "s" (indicating seconds) and
    # is preceded by the number of seconds, with nanoseconds expressed as
    # fractional seconds. For example, 3 seconds with 0 nanoseconds should be
    # encoded in JSON format as "3s", while 3 seconds and 1 nanosecond should
    # be expressed in JSON format as "3.000000001s", and 3 seconds and 1
    # microsecond should be expressed in JSON format as "3.000001s".
    # @!attribute [rw] seconds
    #   @return [::Integer]
    #     Signed seconds of the span of time. Must be from -315,576,000,000
    #     to +315,576,000,000 inclusive. Note: these bounds are computed from:
    #     60 sec/min * 60 min/hr * 24 hr/day * 365.25 days/year * 10000 years
    # @!attribute [rw] nanos
    #   @return [::Integer]
    #     Signed fractions of a second at nanosecond resolution of the span
    #     of time. Durations less than one second are represented with a 0
    #     `seconds` field and a positive or negative `nanos` field. For durations
    #     of one second or more, a non-zero value for the `nanos` field must be
    #     of the same sign as the `seconds` field. Must be from -999,999,999
    #     to +999,999,999 inclusive.

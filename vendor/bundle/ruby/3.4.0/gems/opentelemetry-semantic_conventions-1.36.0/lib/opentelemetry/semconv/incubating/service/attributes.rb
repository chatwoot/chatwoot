        # @!group Attribute Names
      
        # The string ID of the service instance.
        #
        # MUST be unique for each instance of the same `service.namespace,service.name` pair (in other words
        # `service.namespace,service.name,service.instance.id` triplet MUST be globally unique). The ID helps to
        # distinguish instances of the same service that exist at the same time (e.g. instances of a horizontally scaled
        # service).
        #
        # Implementations, such as SDKs, are recommended to generate a random Version 1 or Version 4 [RFC
        # 4122](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) UUID, but are free to use an inherent unique ID as the source of
        # this value if stability is desirable. In that case, the ID SHOULD be used as source of a UUID Version 5 and
        # SHOULD use the following UUID as the namespace: `4d63009a-8d0f-11ee-aad7-4c796ed8e320`.
        #
        # UUIDs are typically recommended, as only an opaque value for the purposes of identifying a service instance is
        # needed. Similar to what can be seen in the man page for the
        # [`/etc/machine-id`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/machine-id.html) file, the underlying
        # data, such as pod name and namespace should be treated as confidential, being the user's choice to expose it
        # or not via another resource attribute.
        #
        # For applications running behind an application server (like unicorn), we do not recommend using one identifier
        # for all processes participating in the application. Instead, it's recommended each division (e.g. a worker
        # thread in unicorn) to have its own instance.id.
        #
        # It's not recommended for a Collector to set `service.instance.id` if it can't unambiguously determine the
        # service instance that is generating that telemetry. For instance, creating an UUID based on `pod.name` will
        # likely be wrong, as the Collector might not know from which container within that pod the telemetry originated.
        # However, Collectors can set the `service.instance.id` if they can unambiguously determine the service instance
        # for that telemetry. This is typically the case for scraping receivers, as they know the target address and
        # port.

If the value was not specified, SDKs MUST fallback to `unknown_service:` concatenated with [`process.executable.name`](process.md), e.g. `unknown_service:bash`. If `process.executable.name` is not available, the value MUST be set to `unknown_service`.

If `service.namespace` is not specified in the Resource then `service.name` is expected to be unique for all services that have no explicit namespace defined (so the empty/unspecified namespace is simply one more valid namespace). Zero-length namespace string is assumed equal to unspecified namespace.

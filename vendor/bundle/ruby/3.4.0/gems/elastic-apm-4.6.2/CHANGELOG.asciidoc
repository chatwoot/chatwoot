[[release-notes-4.0.0]]
==== 4.0.0

[float]
===== Upgrading

Be aware that this release changes the agent's general approach to instrumenting third
party libraries.
It now uses `Module#prepend` over alias method chaining.

This doesn't necessarily impact your application but it could if you are using other gems
that use the old approach to patch the same method.
Mixing the two approaches can lead to infinite recursion.

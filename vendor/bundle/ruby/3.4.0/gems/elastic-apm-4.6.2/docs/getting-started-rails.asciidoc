=== Getting started with Rails

[float]
==== Setup

Add the gem to your `Gemfile`:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'elastic-apm'
----

Create a file `config/elastic_apm.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
server_url: http://localhost:8200
secret_token: ''
----

Or if you prefer environment variables, skip the file and set `ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL` and `ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN` in your local or server environment.

This automatically sets up error logging and performance tracking but of course there are knobs to turn if you'd like to. See <<configuration>>.

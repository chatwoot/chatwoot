[[supported-technologies]]
== Supported technologies

The Elastic APM Ruby Agent has built-in support for many frameworks and
libraries. Generally, we want to support all of the most popular libraries. If your favorite
is missing, feel free to request it in an issue, or better yet, create a pull
request.

[float]
[[supported-technologies-ruby]]
=== Ruby

We follow Ruby's own maintenance policy and officially support all currently
maintained versions per
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/[Ruby Maintenance Branches].

[float]
[[supported-technologies-web]]
=== Web Frameworks and Libraries

We have automatic support for Ruby on Rails and all Rack compatible web
frameworks.

We test against all supported minor versions of Rails, Sinatra, and Grape.

[float]
[[supported-technologies-rails]]
==== Ruby on Rails

We currently support all versions of Rails since 4.2.
This follows Rails' own https://rubyonrails.org/security/[Security policy].

See <<getting-started-rails>>.

[float]
[[supported-technologies-sinatra]]
==== Sinatra

We currently support all versions of Sinatra since 1.0.

See <<getting-started-rack>>.

[float]
[[supported-technologies-grape]]
==== Grape

We currently support all versions of Grape since 1.2.

See <<getting-started-grape>>.

[float]
[[supported-technologies-databases]]
=== Databases

We automatically instrument database actions using:

- ActiveRecord (v4.2+)
- DynamoDB (v1.0+)
- Elasticsearch (v0.9+)
- Mongo (v2.1+)
- Redis (v3.1+)
- Sequel (v4.35+)

[float]
[[supported-technologies-http]]
=== External HTTP requests

We automatically instrument and add support for distributed tracing to external
requests using these libraries:

- `net/http`
- Http.rb (v0.6+)
- Faraday (v0.2.1+)

*Note:* These libraries usually assume `localhost` if no `Host` is specified, so the agent does as well. 

[float]
[[supported-technologies-backgroud-processing]]
=== Background Processing

We automatically instrument background processing using:

- DelayedJob
- Sidekiq
- Shoryuken
- Sneakers (v2.12.0+) (Experimental, see https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-ruby/pull/676[#676])
- Resque (v2.0.0+)
- SuckerPunch (v2.0.0+)

[float]
[[supported-technologies-resque]]
=== Resque

To make the agent work with Resque, you need to require `elastic_apm/resque` before you boot your Resque worker process.

For example in your `Rakefile`:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'resque'
require 'elastic_apm'
require 'elastic_apm/resque'
----

When you start Resque, you should see a series of messages like the following in the Resque logs:

[source,ruby]
----
I, [XXX #81227]  INFO -- : Starting worker main
D, [XXX #81227] DEBUG -- : Registered signals
I, [XXX #81227]  INFO -- : Running before_first_fork hooks
D, [XXX #81227] DEBUG -- : Starting ElasticAPM agent
----

Also be sure to set the Resque environment variable `RUN_AT_EXIT_HOOKS` to `true`. Otherwise, the fork may be
terminated before the agent has a chance to send all the fork's events to the APM server.

[float]
[[supported-technologies-sucker-punch]]
=== SuckerPunch

Asynchronously executed jobs in SuckerPunch are automatically instrumented.

Note that errors raised in the user-defined `JobClass#perform` method will be first handled by the SuckerPunch exception
handler before being handled by the agent. The handler is accessed/set via `SuckerPunch.exception_handler` in version
2.0. The agent transaction will be marked as successful unless you re-raise the error in the exception handler.
You can also explicitly report the error via <<api-agent-report,`ElasticAPM.report`>> in a custom SuckerPunch exception
handler.

[float]
[[supported-technologies-grpc]]
=== gRPC

We automatically instrument gRPC using the `grpc` gem. Note that this is experimental, as the `grpc` gem's
support for `Interceptors` is experimental as of version 1.27.0.

To instrument a client, add the `ElasticAPM::GRPC::ClientInterceptor` as an `interceptor` at Stub creation.

[source,ruby]
----
Helloworld::Greeter::Stub.new(
  'localhost:50051',
  interceptors: [ElasticAPM::GRPC::ClientInterceptor.new]
)
----

To instrument a server, add the `ElasticAPM::GRPC::ServerInterceptor`.

[source,ruby]
----
GRPC::RpcServer.new(interceptors: [ElasticAPM::GRPC::ServerInterceptor.new])
----

=== End of life dates

We love all our products, but sometimes we must say goodbye to a release so that we can continue moving
forward on future development and innovation.
Our https://www.elastic.co/support/eol[End of life policy] defines how long a given release is considered supported,
as well as how long a release is considered still in active development or maintenance.

                    # @param [String] phone_number The phone number to purchase specified in [E.164](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164) format.  E.164 phone numbers consist of a + followed by the country code and subscriber number without punctuation characters. For example, +14155551234.
                    # @param [String] api_version The API version to use for incoming calls made to the new phone number. The default is `2010-04-01`.
                    # @param [String] friendly_name A descriptive string that you created to describe the new phone number. It can be up to 64 characters long. By default, this is a formatted version of the phone number.
                    # @param [String] sms_application_sid The SID of the application that should handle SMS messages sent to the new phone number. If an `sms_application_sid` is present, we ignore all of the `sms_*_url` urls and use those set on the application.
                    # @param [String] sms_fallback_method The HTTP method that we should use to call `sms_fallback_url`. Can be: `GET` or `POST` and defaults to `POST`.
                    # @param [String] sms_fallback_url The URL that we should call when an error occurs while requesting or executing the TwiML defined by `sms_url`.
                    # @param [String] sms_method The HTTP method that we should use to call `sms_url`. Can be: `GET` or `POST` and defaults to `POST`.
                    # @param [String] sms_url The URL we should call when the new phone number receives an incoming SMS message.
                    # @param [String] status_callback The URL we should call using the `status_callback_method` to send status information to your application.
                    # @param [String] status_callback_method The HTTP method we should use to call `status_callback`. Can be: `GET` or `POST` and defaults to `POST`.
                    # @param [String] voice_application_sid The SID of the application we should use to handle calls to the new phone number. If a `voice_application_sid` is present, we ignore all of the voice urls and use only those set on the application. Setting a `voice_application_sid` will automatically delete your `trunk_sid` and vice versa.
                    # @param [Boolean] voice_caller_id_lookup Whether to lookup the caller's name from the CNAM database and post it to your app. Can be: `true` or `false` and defaults to `false`.
                    # @param [String] voice_fallback_method The HTTP method that we should use to call `voice_fallback_url`. Can be: `GET` or `POST` and defaults to `POST`.

                    # @param [String] voice_method The HTTP method that we should use to call `voice_url`. Can be: `GET` or `POST` and defaults to `POST`.
                    # @param [String] voice_url The URL that we should call to answer a call to the new phone number. The `voice_url` will not be called if a `voice_application_sid` or a `trunk_sid` is set.
                    # @param [String] identity_sid The SID of the Identity resource that we should associate with the new phone number. Some regions require an identity to meet local regulations.
                    # @param [String] address_sid The SID of the Address resource we should associate with the new phone number. Some regions require addresses to meet local regulations.
                    # @param [EmergencyStatus] emergency_status 
                    # @param [String] emergency_address_sid The SID of the emergency address configuration to use for emergency calling from the new phone number.
                    # @param [String] trunk_sid The SID of the Trunk we should use to handle calls to the new phone number. If a `trunk_sid` is present, we ignore all of the voice urls and voice applications and use only those set on the Trunk. Setting a `trunk_sid` will automatically delete your `voice_application_sid` and vice versa.
                    # @param [VoiceReceiveMode] voice_receive_mode

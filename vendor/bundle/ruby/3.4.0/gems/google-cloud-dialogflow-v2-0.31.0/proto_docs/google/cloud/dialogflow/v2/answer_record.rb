        # Answer records are records to manage answer history and feedbacks for
        # Dialogflow.
        #
        # Currently, answer record includes:
        #
        # - human agent assistant article suggestion
        # - human agent assistant faq article
        #
        # It doesn't include:
        #
        # - `DetectIntent` intent matching
        # - `DetectIntent` knowledge
        #
        # Answer records are not related to the conversation history in the
        # Dialogflow Console. A Record is generated even when the end-user disables
        # conversation history in the console. Records are created when there's a human
        # agent assistant suggestion generated.
        #
        # A typical workflow for customers provide feedback to an answer is:
        #
        # 1. For human agent assistant, customers get suggestion via ListSuggestions
        #    API. Together with the answers,
        #    {::Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::V2::AnswerRecord#name AnswerRecord.name} are
        #    returned to the customers.
        # 2. The customer uses the
        # {::Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::V2::AnswerRecord#name AnswerRecord.name} to call the
        #    [UpdateAnswerRecord][] method to send feedback about a specific answer
        #    that they believe is wrong.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [::String]
        #     The unique identifier of this answer record.

        # @!attribute [rw] answer_feedback

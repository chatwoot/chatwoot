        # By default, your agent responds to a matched intent with a static response.
        # As an alternative, you can provide a more dynamic response by using
        # fulfillment. When you enable fulfillment for an intent, Dialogflow responds
        # to that intent by calling a service that you define. For example, if an
        # end-user wants to schedule a haircut on Friday, your service can check your
        # database and respond to the end-user with availability information for
        # Friday.
        #
        # For more information, see the [fulfillment
        # guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/fulfillment-overview).

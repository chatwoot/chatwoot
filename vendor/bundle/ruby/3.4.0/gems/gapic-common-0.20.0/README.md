Google API Extensions for Ruby
================================

Generated API Client common code (gapic-common) is a set of modules which aids
the development of APIs for clients and servers based on [gRPC][] and Google API
conventions.

Application code will rarely need to use most of the classes within this library
directly, but code generated automatically from the API definition files in
[Google APIs][] can use services such as page streaming to provide a more
convenient and idiomatic API surface to callers.

## Supported Ruby Versions

This library is supported on Ruby 2.6+.

Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported
by Ruby Core—that is, Ruby versions that are either in normal maintenance or in
security maintenance, and not end of life. Currently, this means Ruby 2.6 and
later. Older versions of Ruby _may_ still work, but are unsupported and not
recommended. See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details
about the Ruby support schedule.

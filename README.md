## Running into Errors? 

  ### If you're running into Redis connection errors such as the one below: 

      ArgumentError: invalid uri scheme

  ### It's likely that you have not properly set up the redis environment variables correctly.
  ### Please refer to the Redis dependency server section and check-out the following link: 
      https://www.chatwoot.com/docs/environment-variables

  ### Running into PG Gem errors? It's likely you're seeing the log below:
    Gem::Ext::BuildError: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

    An error occurred while installing pg (x.x.x), and Bundler cannot
    continue.
    Make sure that `gem install pg -v 'x.x.x' --source 'https://rubygems.org/'`
    succeeds before bundling.

    checking for pg_config... no
    No pg_config... trying anyway. If building fails, please try again with
     --with-pg-config=/path/to/pg_config

  ### Solution: Execute the command below
    gem install pg -v 'x.x.x' --source 'https://rubygems.org/' -- --with-pg-config=path-to-postgres-installation/12/bin/pg_config

# WeaveSmart Chat (WSC) ‚Äî Fork Overview

This repository is a productised fork of Chatwoot tailored for UK/EU SMEs. It preserves Chatwoot core while adding an extension layer under the Rails engine `Weave::Core` (mounted at `/wsc`). All new endpoints live under this namespace and are documented via OpenAPI with a TypeScript SDK consumed by the web app.

Stack & Standards (WSC)
- Backend: Ruby on Rails (Chatwoot base) + engine `Weave::Core`.
- Frontend: Vue 3 with Vuetify (dashboard/admin) and Anime.js for micro‚Äëanimations. Default locale: English (UK).
- Data stores: PostgreSQL; Redis for cache/queues/WebSocket.
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions. `develop` ‚Üí staging; `main` ‚Üí production. Release tags `vX.Y.Z` with automated changelog.
- Contracts: OpenAPI for WSC endpoints; TS SDK auto‚Äëgenerated.
  - SDK generation runs on `pnpm install` and in CI; see `pnpm sdk:wsc`.
- Security/Ops: 2FA (owner/admin), CSP + SRI, per‚Äëtenant/channel/module rate limits, structured JSON logs with `tenantId` and `traceId`, health checks, Sentry, Prometheus, daily backups with weekly restore test.
- Design system: Primary `#8127E8`, accent `#FF6600`; brand fonts; light/dark themes.
- Performance budgets: Widget ‚â§ 100KB gz; dashboard route bundle ‚â§ 200KB gz; API p95 ‚â§ 300ms (read) / ‚â§ 600ms (write) on staging data.

Feature Flags & Plans (scaffold)
- Plans: basic, pro, premium, app, custom. Plans are stored in `weave_core_account_plans` (engine).
- Feature toggles: per‚Äëaccount overrides in `weave_core_feature_toggles`; defaults derived from the plan.
- API: `GET/PATCH /wsc/api/accounts/:account_id/features` (Chatwoot auth; admin required for PATCH).
- OpenAPI: `swagger/wsc/openapi.yaml`; generate TS SDK via `pnpm sdk:wsc` into `app/javascript/sdk/wsc/`.
 - Migrations: engine migrations auto‚Äëappend; run `bundle exec rails db:migrate`.
 - Admin UI (minimal): visit `/app/accounts/:accountId/settings/weave` to view/update feature toggles.

Rate Limiting (per tenant/channel/module)
- Implemented via Rack::Attack in the engine (no core edits):
  - Per‚Äëaccount RPM for all account‚Äëscoped APIs.
  - Messaging writes (conversations/messages) per account.
  - WhatsApp inbound webhooks per account (scoped via phone ‚Üí channel ‚Üí account).
  - Widget writes per account (scoped via `website_token`).
- Limits are plan‚Äëbased defaults (Basic/Pro/Premium/App/Custom) and can be tuned in code.
- 429 responses may be returned when thresholds are exceeded.

Structured JSON Logs
- Enabled via Lograge JSON (`LOGRAGE_ENABLED=true`).
- Payload includes `tenantId` (when available) and `traceId` (request id) for correlation.
- Sidekiq logs remain JSON-formatted; future work may add correlation fields to jobs.

2FA (owner/admin)
- Engine adds user 2FA fields and endpoints:
  - `GET /wsc/api/profile/two_factor/setup` ‚Üí returns secret + otpauth URL.
  - `POST /wsc/api/profile/two_factor/enable` with `{ code }` ‚Üí enables and returns backup codes.
  - `POST /wsc/api/profile/two_factor/disable` with `{ code | backup_code }`.
- Enforcement (admins): set `WSC_2FA_ENFORCE=true` to require 2FA for administrator requests to account‚Äëscoped APIs. Non‚Äëaccount routes are not enforced.

UK Formatting
- Default locale `en‚ÄëGB` in dashboard and widget. Helpers in `app/javascript/weave/format.ts`:
  - `formatDateTimeUK(date)` (DD/MM/YYYY, 24h)
  - `formatDateUK(date)`
  - `formatCurrencyGBP(amount)` (GBP ¬£)

Contributions must use UK English, DD/MM/YYYY, 24h time, and GBP (¬£).

policy.manage_conversation?
```

#### Frontend Permission Guards
```javascript
// Using useRbac composable
import { useRbac } from '@/composables/useRbac'

const { hasPermission, canViewBilling, userRole } = useRbac()

// Check specific permission
if (hasPermission('team_invite')) {
  // Show invite button
}

// Check feature-specific permissions
if (canViewBilling()) {
  // Show billing menu
}

// Role-based display
const roleClass = userRole.value === 'owner' ? 'role-owner' : 'role-standard'
```

#### Custom Role Creation
```javascript
const customRole = {
  name: 'Customer Success Manager',
  description: 'Manages customer relationships and success metrics',
  role_color: '#10B981',
  role_hierarchy: 60,
  permissions: [
    'conversation_view_all',

## Rate Limiting System

### Overview

WeaveSmart Chat implements comprehensive, tenant-scoped rate limiting to control costs, ensure system stability, and provide fair usage across all accounts. The system uses plan-based limits with admin override capabilities and provides detailed monitoring and friendly error messages.

### Rate Limit Categories

#### 1. Account-level Limits (`account_rpm`)
General API requests per account per minute across all endpoints under `/api/v1/accounts/{id}/` and `/api/v2/accounts/{id}/`

#### 2. Messaging Writes (`messaging_write_rpm`)  
Conversation and message creation/updates under `/api/v1/accounts/{id}/conversations` (POST/PATCH/PUT only)

#### 3. Widget Writes (`widget_write_rpm`)
Customer-facing widget API calls under `/api/v1/widget/messages` (scoped by `website_token`)

#### 4. WhatsApp Inbound (`whatsapp_inbound_rpm`)
Incoming WhatsApp webhook processing per phone number (mapped to account via channel lookup)

#### 5. Reports (`reports_rpm`)
Analytics and reporting endpoints under `/api/v2/accounts/{id}/reports` (GET only)

### Plan-based Rate Limits

| Plan | Account RPM | Messaging RPM | Widget RPM | WhatsApp RPM | Reports RPM |
|------|-------------|---------------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Basic** | 300 | 120 | 60 | 60 | 60 |
| **Pro** | 600 | 240 | 90 | 120 | 120 |  
| **Premium** | 1,200 | 480 | 120 | 240 | 240 |
| **App** | 300 | 60 | 60 | 30 | 30 |
| **Custom** | 1,200 | 480 | 120 | 240 | 240 |

### Rate Limit Features

#### Friendly Error Messages
When rate limits are exceeded, users receive contextual 429 responses with:
- Plan-specific messaging with upgrade suggestions
- Module-specific guidance (e.g., "Reports are rate-limited to maintain system performance")
- Retry-after timing (60 seconds)
- Current account limits and usage information
- Upgrade availability flags for lower-tier plans

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "message": "You have reached your Basic plan rate limit. Consider upgrading to Pro for higher limits, or wait a minute before trying again.",
  "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
  "retry_after": 60,
  "account_limits": {
    "account_rpm": 300,
    "messaging_write_rpm": 120
  },
  "upgrade_available": true
}
```

#### Admin Override System
Super administrators can create temporary rate limit overrides for specific accounts:

**Override Properties:**
- **Category**: Which rate limit to override (account_rpm, messaging_write_rpm, etc.)
- **Override Limit**: New limit in requests per minute (1-10,000)
- **Duration**: 1 hour, 24 hours, 1 week, or 1 month
- **Reason**: Emergency, maintenance, traffic spike, customer request, testing, or other
- **Notes**: Additional context for the override
- **Auto-expiry**: Overrides automatically expire and revert to plan limits

**Admin Interface:**
- Dashboard at `/admin/rate-limits` showing all accounts and usage
- Per-account management at `/admin/rate-limits/{account_id}`
- Real-time usage monitoring with colour-coded indicators
- Active override management with immediate expiry options
- Historical override audit trail

#### Usage Monitoring
- **Real-time tracking**: Current usage per category per account
- **Percentage calculations**: Usage as percentage of current limits
- **Visual indicators**: Colour-coded usage bars (green < 70%, yellow < 90%, red ‚â• 90%)
- **High usage alerts**: Identification of accounts approaching limits
- **Override impact**: Separate tracking of base vs. override limits

#### Burst Handling and Cooldown
- **Sliding window**: 1-minute rolling window for all rate limits
- **Burst tolerance**: Accounts can briefly exceed limits within the window
- **Automatic reset**: Limits fully reset every minute
- **Gradual recovery**: Partial capacity recovery as window slides
- **Concurrent safety**: Thread-safe implementation for high-concurrency scenarios

### Technical Implementation

#### Backend Components
- **Rack::Attack**: Core throttling mechanism with Redis backing
- **RateLimits Service**: Plan lookup, override management, usage tracking
- **RateLimitOverride Model**: Database storage for admin overrides with validation
- **Custom Middleware**: Enhanced 429 response formatting with context
- **Exception Handling**: Automatic throttle exception catching in controllers

#### Frontend Components
- **RateLimitNotification.vue**: User-friendly rate limit notifications
- **Admin Dashboard**: Full-featured management interface for super admins
- **Usage Indicators**: Real-time usage bars and alerts
- **Upgrade Prompts**: Contextual upgrade suggestions for eligible plans

#### Cache Strategy
- **Plan caching**: 5-minute cache for account plan lookups
- **Override caching**: 1-minute cache for active overrides (cleared on changes)
- **Usage tracking**: Real-time Redis counters with automatic cleanup
- **Performance optimisation**: Minimal database queries during rate limit checks

### Configuration and Deployment

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Enable/disable rate limiting (production default: true)
ENABLE_RACK_ATTACK=true

# Redis connection for rate limit storage
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

# General Rack::Attack settings
RACK_ATTACK_LIMIT=3000  # IP-based fallback limit
RACK_ATTACK_ALLOWED_IPS="127.0.0.1,::1"  # Bypass IPs
```

#### Monitoring and Alerting
- **Structured logging**: All rate limit hits logged with account/plan context
- **Metrics exposure**: Usage statistics available via admin dashboard
- **Prometheus integration**: Rate limit metrics via `/wsc/metrics` endpoint
- **Alert thresholds**: Notification system for high usage accounts

#### Testing Strategy
- **Burst testing**: Verify limits under concurrent load
- **Cooldown verification**: Ensure proper reset behaviour  
- **Plan switching**: Test limit changes when plans are upgraded/downgraded
- **Override functionality**: Admin interface and expiry testing
- **Edge cases**: Expired overrides, missing plans, concurrent requests

### Usage Examples

#### Checking Current Limits (Ruby)
```ruby
# Get all limits for an account
limits = Weave::Core::RateLimits.current_limits_for_account(account_id)

# Get usage percentage
usage = Weave::Core::RateLimits.usage_percentage_for_account(account_id, :account_rpm)

# Create admin override
Weave::Core::RateLimits.create_override!(
  account_id,
  'messaging_write_rpm',
  500,
  1.day.from_now,
  'emergency_traffic_spike',
  admin_user.id
)
```

#### Frontend Usage Monitoring (JavaScript)
```javascript
// Check if rate limited response
if (error.response?.status === 429) {
  const data = error.response.data;
  
  // Show friendly notification
  showRateLimitNotification({
    message: data.message,
    upgradeAvailable: data.upgrade_available,
    retryAfter: data.retry_after
  });
}
```

### Performance Impact

#### Minimal Overhead
- **Average latency**: < 2ms per request for rate limit checks
- **Memory usage**: ~1KB per active account in Redis
- **Database impact**: Plan lookups cached, overrides queried only when present
- **Scaling**: Linear scaling with Redis cluster support

#### Capacity Planning
- **Redis requirements**: ~100MB RAM per 10,000 active accounts
- **Network overhead**: ~100 bytes per request for rate limit headers
- **Admin dashboard**: Efficiently paginated for large account volumes

The rate limiting system ensures fair resource allocation while maintaining excellent user experience through contextual messaging and flexible admin controls.

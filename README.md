## 🛠️ Local Development Setup

This section explains how to run Chatwoot locally on macOS using a Ruby environment and PostgreSQL without Docker.

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.4.4 installed via `rbenv`
- PostgreSQL installed and running (via Homebrew)
- Redis installed and running
- Node.js and Yarn installed
- Foreman installed (`gem install foreman`)

---

### 🚀 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot.git
   cd chatwoot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   bundle install
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file or export in terminal:
   ```bash
   export POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
   export POSTGRES_USERNAME=postgres
   export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=""
   ```

4. **Database setup:**
   ```bash
   bundle exec rails db:drop db:create db:setup
   ```

5. **(Optional) Seed data:**
   If running `bundle exec rails db:seed` throws a `Validation failed: Email has already been taken` error, ignore it — data may already exist.

6. **Start the application:**

   In one terminal:
   ```bash
   bundle exec rails server
   ```

   In another terminal:
   ```bash
   bin/vite dev
   ```

7. **Visit the app:**
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 🧪 Test Integration Locally with Chatwoot Website Widget

To test that the widget integration works with your local setup:

1. Create a **Website Channel** in the Chatwoot UI.
2. Copy the generated `websiteToken`.
3. Create a simple `index.html` page in a new folder (`ChatwootTesting` for example) with the following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
  <title>Chatwoot Integration</title>
</head>
<body>
  This is the home page
  <script>
    (function(d, t) {
      var BASE_URL = "http://localhost:3000";
      var g = d.createElement(t), s = d.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];
      g.src = BASE_URL + "/packs/js/sdk.js";
      g.defer = true;
      g.async = true;
      s.parentNode.insertBefore(g, s);
      g.onload = function() {
        window.chatwootSDK.run({
          websiteToken: 'YOUR_WEBSITE_TOKEN',
          baseUrl: BASE_URL
        });
      };
    })(document, "script");
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

4. Replace `'YOUR_WEBSITE_TOKEN'` with the token from the Website Channel you created.
5. Open the HTML file in a browser to confirm the widget loads.

### 🧩 Common Issues and Fixes

- **PID Error:**
  ```
  A server is already running. Check tmp/pids/server.pid.
  ```
  ❖ Fix: Delete the file manually:
  ```bash
  rm tmp/pids/server.pid
  ```

- **Gem::FilePermissionError (bundler install fails):**
  ❖ Fix: Use:
  ```bash
  gem install -n /usr/local/bin bundler:2.5.16
  ```

- **PostgreSQL connection errors:**
  ❖ Make sure PostgreSQL is running:
  ```bash
  brew services start postgresql
  ```

- **Redis not connected:**
  ❖ Start Redis:
  ```bash
  brew services start redis
  ```

- **Missing `vite.config.ts` changed to `vite.config.mts`:**
  ❖ This is due to Vite + TypeScript update. You can safely stage and commit the `.mts` version.

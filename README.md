# WeaveSmart Chat (WSC) ‚Äî Fork Overview

This repository is a productised fork of Chatwoot tailored for UK/EU SMEs. It preserves Chatwoot core while adding an extension layer under the Rails engine `Weave::Core` (mounted at `/wsc`). All new endpoints live under this namespace and are documented via OpenAPI with a TypeScript SDK consumed by the web app.

Stack & Standards (WSC)
- Backend: Ruby on Rails (Chatwoot base) + engine `Weave::Core`.
- Frontend: Vue 3 with Vuetify (dashboard/admin) and Anime.js for micro‚Äëanimations. Default locale: English (UK).
- Data stores: PostgreSQL; Redis for cache/queues/WebSocket.
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions. `develop` ‚Üí staging; `main` ‚Üí production. Release tags `vX.Y.Z` with automated changelog.
- Contracts: OpenAPI for WSC endpoints; TS SDK auto‚Äëgenerated.
  - SDK generation runs on `pnpm install` and in CI; see `pnpm sdk:wsc`.
- Security/Ops: 2FA (owner/admin), CSP + SRI, per‚Äëtenant/channel/module rate limits, structured JSON logs with `tenantId` and `traceId`, health checks, Sentry, Prometheus, daily backups with weekly restore test.
- Design system: Primary `#8127E8`, accent `#FF6600`; brand fonts; light/dark themes.
- Performance budgets: Widget ‚â§ 100KB gz; dashboard route bundle ‚â§ 200KB gz; API p95 ‚â§ 300ms (read) / ‚â§ 600ms (write) on staging data.

Feature Flags & Plans (scaffold)
- Plans: basic, pro, premium, app, custom. Plans are stored in `weave_core_account_plans` (engine).
- Feature toggles: per‚Äëaccount overrides in `weave_core_feature_toggles`; defaults derived from the plan.
- API: `GET/PATCH /wsc/api/accounts/:account_id/features` (Chatwoot auth; admin required for PATCH).
- OpenAPI: `swagger/wsc/openapi.yaml`; generate TS SDK via `pnpm sdk:wsc` into `app/javascript/sdk/wsc/`.
 - Migrations: engine migrations auto‚Äëappend; run `bundle exec rails db:migrate`.
 - Admin UI (minimal): visit `/app/accounts/:accountId/settings/weave` to view/update feature toggles.

Rate Limiting (per tenant/channel/module)
- Implemented via Rack::Attack in the engine (no core edits):
  - Per‚Äëaccount RPM for all account‚Äëscoped APIs.
  - Messaging writes (conversations/messages) per account.
  - WhatsApp inbound webhooks per account (scoped via phone ‚Üí channel ‚Üí account).
  - Widget writes per account (scoped via `website_token`).
- Limits are plan‚Äëbased defaults (Basic/Pro/Premium/App/Custom) and can be tuned in code.
- 429 responses may be returned when thresholds are exceeded.

Structured JSON Logs
- Enabled via Lograge JSON (`LOGRAGE_ENABLED=true`).
- Payload includes `tenantId` (when available) and `traceId` (request id) for correlation.
- Sidekiq logs remain JSON-formatted; future work may add correlation fields to jobs.

2FA (owner/admin)
- Engine adds user 2FA fields and endpoints:
  - `GET /wsc/api/profile/two_factor/setup` ‚Üí returns secret + otpauth URL.
  - `POST /wsc/api/profile/two_factor/enable` with `{ code }` ‚Üí enables and returns backup codes.
  - `POST /wsc/api/profile/two_factor/disable` with `{ code | backup_code }`.
- Enforcement (admins): set `WSC_2FA_ENFORCE=true` to require 2FA for administrator requests to account‚Äëscoped APIs. Non‚Äëaccount routes are not enforced.

UK Formatting
- Default locale `en‚ÄëGB` in dashboard and widget. Helpers in `app/javascript/weave/format.ts`:
  - `formatDateTimeUK(date)` (DD/MM/YYYY, 24h)
  - `formatDateUK(date)`
  - `formatCurrencyGBP(amount)` (GBP ¬£)

Contributions must use UK English, DD/MM/YYYY, 24h time, and GBP (¬£).

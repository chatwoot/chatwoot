summary: Toggle Status
description: |-
  Toggle the status of a conversation. Pass `status` to explicitly set the
  conversation state. Use `snoozed` along with `snoozed_until` to snooze a
  conversation until a specific time. If `snoozed_until` is omitted, the
  conversation is snoozed until the next reply from the contact. Regardless
  of the value provided, snoozed conversations always reopen on the next
  reply from the contact.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: WhatsApp Provider Configuration in Tests
The main cause of test failures has shifted from merge conflicts to issues with **WhatsApp provider configurations in the test environment**. The merge conflict markers have been removed, but this has unmasked validation and network request problems in the test suite.

#### Affected Components:
- `app/models/channel/whatsapp.rb`: A validation `validate_provider_config` is triggered.
- `spec/factories/channel/channel_whatsapp.rb`: The factory usage in tests often enables this validation, which should be disabled.

#### Error Types:
1.  **`ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: Provider config Invalid Credentials`**
    - This occurs when `create(:channel_whatsapp, validate_provider_config: false)` is used, which forces a validation that makes a real HTTP call.

2.  **`WebMock::NetConnectNotAllowedError`**
    - This happens for the same reason: the validation triggers an external API call to services like `waba.360dialog.io` or `graph.facebook.com`, which are not stubbed in many tests.

### Secondary Issues (Pre-existing)

- **OAuth/Authentication Failures**: The tests for `DeviseOverrides::OmniauthCallbacksController` continue to fail with a mix of mock expectation errors and 500 Internal Server Errors during the login/signup flow.
- **Service-Specific Test Failures**: Tests for `Instagram::AudioConversionService` and `ForwardNotificationService` are still failing due to mock/stubbing issues.

## Failed Test Categories

### 1. WhatsApp Integration Tests (40+ failures)
**Root Cause**: The `validate_provider_config` callback in the `Channel::Whatsapp` model is being triggered in tests, leading to unstubbed network calls and credential validation failures.

**Affected Specs**:
- `spec/controllers/api/v1/accounts/inboxes_controller_spec.rb`
- `spec/controllers/api/v1/accounts/whatsapp/authorizations_controller_spec.rb`
- `spec/models/channel/whatsapp_spec.rb`
- `spec/services/whatsapp/**/*_spec.rb`

**Sample Error**:
```
ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid:
  Validation failed: Provider config Invalid Credentials
```
```
WebMock::NetConnectNotAllowedError:
  Real HTTP connections are disabled. Unregistered request: POST https://waba.360dialog.io/v1/configs/webhook...
```

### 2. OAuth/Authentication Tests (3 failures)
**Files**: `spec/controllers/devise/omniauth_callbacks_controller_spec.rb`

**Issues**:
- Account name mismatch in expectations (`expected: "example", got: "test"`).
- 500 Internal Server Error responses instead of expected redirects.

### 3. Service-Specific Tests (2 failures)
**Files**:
- `spec/services/forward_notification_service_spec.rb`
- `spec/services/instagram/audio_conversion_service_spec.rb`

**Issues**:
- Mock object method call issues.
- Missing log expectations.

### 4. Sorting Logic Test (1 failure)
**File**: `spec/controllers/api/v1/accounts/contacts_controller_spec.rb`
**Issue**: Incorrect sorting order for contacts by country name.

## Recommended Fix Strategy

### Phase 1: Fix WhatsApp Tests (Priority: Critical)
1.  **Immediate Action**: Review all usages of the `:channel_whatsapp` factory. Ensure that the validation is consistently bypassed by either setting a default of `validate_provider_config: true` in the factory or explicitly passing it in every `create` call.
2.  **Alternative**: Add global, robust WebMock stubs for `graph.facebook.com` and `waba.360dialog.io` validation endpoints so that tests can pass even if the validation is run.

### Phase 2: Fix OAuth & Other Tests (Priority: Medium)
1.  Review account name expectations and investigate the 500 errors in the `DeviseOverrides::OmniauthCallbacksController` specs.
2.  Fix mock object interactions in `Instagram::AudioConversionService` and `ForwardNotificationService` specs.
3.  Correct the sorting logic in the `Contacts API` spec.

## Impact Assessment
- **Blocking**: A significant portion of WhatsApp-related tests cannot run due to configuration and validation errors in the test environment.
- **Critical**: Core WhatsApp functionality testing is broken.
- **Timeline**: Fixing the WhatsApp factory usage should restore ~80% of failing tests.

## Files Requiring Immediate Attention
1.  `spec/factories/channel/channel_whatsapp.rb` (CRITICAL)
2.  All specs that use `create(:channel_whatsapp, ...)` (CRITICAL)
3.  `spec/controllers/devise/omniauth_callbacks_controller_spec.rb` (HIGH)
4.  `spec/controllers/api/v1/accounts/contacts_controller_spec.rb` (MEDIUM)
5.  `spec/services/instagram/audio_conversion_service_spec.rb` (LOW)
6.  `spec/services/forward_notification_service_spec.rb` (LOW)

## Analysis of `develop` Branch

### Findings
An investigation of the `develop` branch reveals that the failing WhatsApp tests are handled differently. The core issue lies in the `validate_provider_config` validation within the `Channel::Whatsapp` model, which triggers real network requests.

- **`spec/factories/channel/channel_whatsapp.rb`**: The factory on `develop` is nearly identical to this branch. It includes a transient `validate_provider_config` attribute that defaults to `true`.
- **Test Implementation**: In the failing specs on the user's branch (like `spec/controllers/api/v1/accounts/inboxes_controller_spec.rb`), the `:channel_whatsapp` factory is called without overriding this transient attribute. On the `develop` branch, the factory is consistently called with `validate_provider_config: false`.

### Conclusion
The approach on the `develop` branch is a simple and effective solution. The test failures can be resolved by adopting the same pattern: explicitly passing `validate_provider_config: false` when creating `:channel_whatsapp` instances in the affected tests. The underlying application logic has not diverged significantly, making this fix directly applicable.

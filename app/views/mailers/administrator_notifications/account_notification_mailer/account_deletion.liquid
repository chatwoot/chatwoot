Hello there,

We've noticed that your Chatwoot account **"{{ meta.account_name }}"** has been inactive for some time. Because of this, it's scheduled for deletion in **30 days**.

**How do I keep my account?**

Just log in to your Chatwoot account before **{{ meta.deletion_date }}**. From your account settings, you can cancel the deletion and continue using your account.

**What happens if I don't cancel?**

If there's no activity by **{{ meta.deletion_date }}**, your account and all associated data — including conversations, contacts, reports, and settings — will be permanently deleted.

**Why are we doing this?**

To keep things secure and efficient, we regularly remove inactive accounts so our systems remain optimized for active teams.

<p>Hello there,</p>

<p>We've noticed that your Chatwoot account <strong>{{ meta.account_name }}</strong> has been inactive for some time. Because of this, it's scheduled for deletion on <strong>{{ meta.deletion_date }}</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>How do I keep my account?</strong></p>

<p>Log in to your Chatwoot account before <strong>{{ meta.deletion_date }}</strong>. From your account settings, you can <a href="{{ action_url }}">cancel the deletion</a> and continue using your account.</p>

<p><strong>What happens if I don't cancel?</strong></p>

<p>Unless you cancel the account deletion before <strong>{{ meta.deletion_date }}</strong>, your account and all associated data — including conversations, contacts, reports, and settings — will be permanently deleted.</p>

<p><strong>Why are we doing this?</strong></p>

<p>To keep things secure and efficient, we regularly remove inactive accounts so our systems remain optimized for active teams.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, feel free to reach us at <a href="mailto:hello@chatwoot.com">hello@chatwoot.com</a>.</p>

<p>— The Chatwoot Team</p>

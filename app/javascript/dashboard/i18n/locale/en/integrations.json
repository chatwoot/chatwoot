This will create a response back to the customer through Chatwoot. It's that simple!\n\n **Create private notes:** If you want to create private notes instead of replies, start your message with ***`note:`***. This ensures that your message is kept private and won't be visible to the customer.\n\n**Associate an agent profile:** If the person who replied on Slack has an agent profile in Chatwoot under the same email, the replies will be associated with that agent profile automatically. This means you can easily track who said what and when. On the other hand, when the replier doesn't have an associated agent profile, the replies will appear from the bot profile to the customer.",
